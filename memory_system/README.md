# 🧠 AI Learning Memory System

## ⚡ **One-File Solution**

This is the **complete revision planning system** in just **ONE HTML file**! No complicated setup, no dependencies, just pure learning optimization.

## 🚀 **Quick Start**

1. **Open the file**: Double-click `revision_planner.html` in your browser
2. **Scan repository**: Click "🔍 Scan Repository" 
3. **Start learning**: Review topics and rate difficulty (😰😐😊)
4. **Let the system optimize**: Smart scheduling based on forgetting curve

That's it! The system does everything automatically.

## ✨ **Key Features**

### 🔍 **Smart Topic Discovery**
- **Hierarchical Structure**: Automatically organizes topics into chapters
- **Category Detection**: ML, Deep Learning, GenAI, Coding, Data Science
- **File Analysis**: Suggests `_notes` naming convention for better organization

### 📅 **Intelligent Scheduling**
- **Forgetting Curve**: Based on Ebbinghaus research (33.7% retention after 1 day)
- **Adaptive Intervals**: 1→3→7→14→30 days based on your performance
- **Difficulty Adjustment**: Hard topics reviewed more frequently

### 📊 **Progress Tracking**
- **Topic Groups**: Organized by learning tracks (100 Days ML, Binary Search Mastery, etc.)
- **Chapter Progress**: Track completion within each topic
- **Analytics Dashboard**: See your learning patterns and retention rates

### 🎯 **Performance-Based Learning**
- **😰 Hard**: Review sooner (interval × 0.6)
- **😐 Medium**: Normal progression (interval × ease_factor)  
- **😊 Easy**: Longer intervals (interval × 1.3)

## 📁 **Repository Organization**

### **Current Structure** → **Optimized Structure**
```
CampusX/100 days-ml/1-What is ML/          → Ch.1: What is ML
CampusX/100 days-ml/2-AI vs ML vs DL/      → Ch.2: AI vs ML vs DL
coding/Binary_search/00-concepts.ipynb     → Ch.1: Binary Search Concepts
coding/Binary_search/01-Count...ipynb      → Ch.2: Count Elements
```

### **File Naming Convention**
The system works best with files named: `XX_topic_name_notes.md/ipynb`

Examples:
- `01_what_is_ml_notes.md`
- `00_binary_search_concepts_notes.ipynb`
- `03_cnn_architecture_notes.md`

Use the **"📝 Auto-Rename Files"** button to get suggestions for your existing files.

## 🎨 **Interface Overview**

### **📚 Topics Tab**
- **Topic Groups**: Expandable sections for each learning track
- **Chapter List**: Individual chapters with progress and due dates
- **Filters**: Search by status, category, difficulty
- **Quick Actions**: Mark chapters as reviewed with difficulty rating

### **📅 Calendar Tab**  
- **Monthly View**: See which topics are due each day
- **Color Coding**: Green (scheduled), Red (overdue), Blue (due today)
- **Navigation**: Previous/Next month, jump to today

### **📊 Analytics Tab**
- **Progress by Category**: ML, Deep Learning, Coding progress
- **Difficulty Breakdown**: Easy/Medium/Hard distribution  
- **Completion Stats**: Overall progress metrics
- **Topic Performance**: How well you're doing in each area

## 🔧 **Advanced Features**

### **Auto-Detection Algorithm**
The system automatically discovers:
1. **Folder Structure**: Converts folders to topic groups
2. **Numbered Files**: Creates chapter sequences
3. **File Categories**: Based on path and content analysis
4. **Difficulty Levels**: Estimated from keywords and structure

### **Memory Optimization**
- **Spaced Repetition**: Prevents forgetting before it happens
- **Ease Factor**: Adjusts based on your performance history
- **Priority Scheduling**: Overdue topics get highest priority
- **Completion Tracking**: Marks topics as mastered

### **Data Management**
- **Local Storage**: All data saved in browser
- **Export/Import**: JSON format for backup/sharing
- **Reset Option**: Clear all data and start fresh

## 📈 **Learning Workflow**

### **Daily Routine**
1. Open revision planner
2. Check "Due Today" count in stats
3. Review due chapters in order of priority
4. Rate each chapter honestly (😰😐😊)
5. System automatically schedules next review

### **Content Creation Workflow**  
1. Create new learning files
2. Use `_notes` suffix in filename
3. Click "🔍 Scan Repository" to detect new content
4. System automatically schedules for review

### **Progress Monitoring**
1. Check analytics weekly to see trends
2. Focus on topics with low retention rates
3. Celebrate completed topic groups
4. Adjust study methods based on data

## 🎯 **Optimization Tips**

1. **Consistent Naming**: Use `XX_topic_name_notes.ext` format
2. **Honest Ratings**: Accurate difficulty assessment improves the algorithm  
3. **Daily Reviews**: 15 minutes daily beats 2-hour cramming sessions
4. **Regular Scanning**: Re-scan when you add new content
5. **Export Backup**: Save your progress data regularly

## 🔄 **Forgetting Curve Science**

Based on Hermann Ebbinghaus research:
- **Day 0**: 100% retention (just learned)
- **Day 1**: 33.7% retention without review
- **Day 6**: 25.4% retention  
- **Day 31**: 21.1% retention

The system schedules reviews **before** forgetting happens, maximizing retention with minimal time investment.

## 🛟 **Troubleshooting**

### **No Topics Found**
- Ensure you have `.md` or `.ipynb` files in your repository
- Click "🔍 Scan Repository" to discover content
- Check that files are larger than 50 bytes

### **Topics Not Organized Properly**
- Use the "📝 Auto-Rename Files" feature
- Follow the `XX_topic_name_notes.ext` naming convention
- Group related files in folders

### **Data Lost**
- Export your data regularly as backup
- Check browser's local storage hasn't been cleared
- Re-import from backup file if needed
