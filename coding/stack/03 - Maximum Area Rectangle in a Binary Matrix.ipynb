    "## 1. IP–OP–PS (Input, Output, Problem Statement)\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Problem Statement**\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a 2D binary matrix (containing only `0`s and `1`s), find the **maximum rectangular area** consisting entirely of `1`s. Each cell in the matrix can be treated as a bar of height 1 if the cell’s value is `1`; if the cell’s value is `0`, that bar’s height is effectively 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Input**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Two integers, \\(n\\) (number of rows) and \\(m\\) (number of columns).\n",
    "- An \\(n \\times m\\) binary matrix (values are `0` or `1`).\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Output**\n",
    "\n",
    "- A single integer representing the **largest rectangular area** of `1`s in the matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Detailed Example**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Matrix** (4 rows, 5 columns):\n",
    "```\n",
    "[\n",
    "  [1, 0, 1, 1, 1],\n",
    "  [1, 1, 1, 1, 1],\n",
    "  [0, 1, 1, 0, 1],\n",

    "]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Possible largest rectangle of `1`s could be:\n",
    "- The rectangle spanning rows 1 to 3 (0-based indexing) and columns 1 to 3, which has area = \\(3 \\times 3 = 9\\).  \n",
    "- Or another rectangle spanning multiple columns in a single row.  \n",
    "- We systematically check each row as a histogram to find the maximum area rectangle.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this example, the maximum area is often **9** (though it can vary based on the matrix’s layout).\n",

    "## 2. Identification\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Why Use the Stack Technique (Max Area Histogram)?**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Link to Maximum Area Histogram**  \n",
    "   - Each row of the binary matrix can be treated as a base.  \n",
    "   - If we consider row \\(i\\), we accumulate “heights” of consecutive `1`s from row 0 up to row \\(i\\).  \n",
    "   - Then, we apply the **Maximum Area Histogram** (MAH) approach to that row of heights.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Key Cues**  \n",
    "   - For each row, the brute force approach might scan the entire submatrix, leading to a large complexity.  \n",
    "   - By reusing the known O(\\(m\\)) stack-based solution for each row, we achieve O(\\(n \\times m\\)) overall.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Characteristics**  \n",
    "   - You only need to keep track of how many consecutive `1`s appear **vertically** up to the current row.  \n",
    "   - Whenever you encounter a `0`, that height resets to 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Break Down → Row-by-Row Histogram Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Step-by-Step Sub-Tasks**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initialize a Height Array**  \n",
    "   - Create an array `height[m]` (for \\(m\\) columns) to store consecutive vertical `1` counts.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Process Each Row**  \n",
    "   - For row \\(i\\) (from 0 to \\(n-1\\)):  \n",
    "     - Update `height[j]`:\n",
    "       - If `matrix[i][j] == 1`, then `height[j] += 1`.  \n",
    "       - Else, `height[j] = 0`.  \n",
    "     - Now, `height` represents a histogram for row \\(i\\).  \n",
    "     - Compute **Max Area Histogram** (MAH) for this `height` array to get the largest rectangle in row 0..i.  \n",
    "     - Track the global maximum area.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Data Structures Used**  \n",
    "   - A **stack** for the Max Area Histogram routine.  \n",
    "   - An integer array `height` of length \\(m\\) to accumulate heights of consecutive `1`s.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Overall Time Complexity**  \n",
    "   - Each row calls the MAH function in O(\\(m\\)) time.  \n",
    "   - There are \\(n\\) rows.  \n",
    "   - Total time complexity = **O(\\(n \\times m\\))**.\n",

    "\n",
    "### **Detailed Explanation of Each Step**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Building the Height Array**  \n",
    "   - Initialize `height` to all zeros.  \n",
    "   - For each row \\(i\\), update `height[j]` based on the current cell:\n",
    "     \\[\n",
    "       \\text{height}[j] = \n",
    "       \\begin{cases}\n",
    "       \\text{height}[j] + 1 & \\text{if } \\text{matrix}[i][j] = 1\\\\\n",
    "       0 & \\text{otherwise}\n",
    "       \\end{cases}\n",
    "     \\]\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Max Area Histogram (MAH) on `height`**  \n",
    "   - Use the well-known stack-based approach to find the largest rectangle in O(\\(m\\)) time.  \n",
    "   - Maintain a **monotonically increasing** stack of bar indices:\n",
    "     - When a bar of smaller height is encountered, pop from the stack and compute area for the popped bar.  \n",
    "     - The area is `height_of_popped_bar * (current_index - stack_top_after_pop - 1)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Keep Track of Global Maximum**  \n",
    "   - After computing the max area for the histogram of row \\(i\\), compare it with a global maximum.  \n",
    "   - The final global maximum after processing all rows is the answer.\n",

    "2. Keep track of the maximum height encountered so far from the **left** side (`leftMax`) and from the **right** side (`rightMax`).\n",

    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Step-by-Step Explanation**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initialization**:\n",
    "   - `left = 0`, `right = n - 1`\n",
    "   - `leftMax = 0`, `rightMax = 0` (to store the highest bar seen so far from the left and right sides, respectively)\n",
    "   - `totalWater = 0`\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **While `left < right`**:\n",
    "   - If `height[left] <= height[right]`:\n",
    "     - If `height[left] >= leftMax`, update `leftMax = height[left]`.\n",
    "       - (No water is trapped on top of this bar because it defines a new left boundary.)\n",
    "     - Else, the bar is lower than `leftMax`; water trapped here = `leftMax - height[left]`.\n",
    "     - Move the left pointer: `left++`.\n",
    "   - Else (meaning `height[left] > height[right]`):\n",
    "     - If `height[right] >= rightMax`, update `rightMax = height[right]`.\n",

    "     - Move the right pointer: `right--`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Why it Works**:\n",
    "   - Whichever side is lower (left or right), we know the water trapped on that side depends on how tall the boundary is from that same side (leftMax or rightMax).\n",
    "   - If the left side is lower, we move `left` inward, because the right side is guaranteed to have a boundary that is at least as high as `height[right]`. The same logic applies in reverse if the right side is lower.\n",

    "- **Stack Method**: We push indices of bars in decreasing order of heights. When we see a bar taller than the top of the stack, we pop and calculate trapped water using the new top as the left boundary.  \n",
    "- **Two-Pointer Method**: We keep track of `leftMax` and `rightMax` from each side. Whichever side is lower, we move that pointer inward, because that side’s water depends on its own boundary.\n",

    "Both approaches yield **O(n)** time complexity for the Rain Water Trapping problem."
