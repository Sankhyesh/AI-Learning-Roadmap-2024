    "# Comprehensive Handout: Stock Span Problem Using a Stack\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. IP–OP–PS (Input, Output, Problem Statement)\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Problem Statement**\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the daily stock prices of a company for \\(n\\) consecutive days, you need to compute the “span” of the stock’s price for each day. The span for a particular day is defined as the number of consecutive days (up to and including that day) for which the stock’s price was **less than or equal** to its price on the current day.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Input**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. An integer \\(n\\) (the number of days).\n",
    "2. An array of \\(n\\) integers, where each integer represents the stock price on that day.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Output**\n",
    "\n",
    "- An array of \\(n\\) integers, where the \\(i\\)-th integer is the span of the stock on day \\(i\\).\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Detailed Example**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Input:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "n = 7\n",
    "prices = [100, 80, 60, 70, 60, 75, 85]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Output:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "span = [1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 4, 6]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Day 0 (price = 100):** No previous days → span = 1  \n",
    "2. **Day 1 (price = 80):** Previous day was 100 (which is higher), so only current day counts → span = 1  \n",
    "3. **Day 2 (price = 60):** Previous days are [100, 80], both higher → span = 1  \n",
    "4. **Day 3 (price = 70):** Previous days are [100, 80, 60]; the first smaller or equal price from the left is `60`, so the span is the distance from day 2 to day 3 plus 1 → span = 2  \n",
    "5. **Day 4 (price = 60):** Previous day (day 3) had 70, which is higher → span = 1  \n",
    "6. **Day 5 (price = 75):** Previous days [100, 80, 60, 70, 60], the nearest lower/equal streak includes day 4 (price=60), day 3 (price=70), day 2 (price=60), so total consecutive days = 4 → span = 4  \n",
    "7. **Day 6 (price = 85):** Looking backward, 75, 60, 70, 60, 80, 100 are all less or equal until day 0’s 100 is not less or equal. So consecutive days = 6 → span = 6  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Identification\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Why is this a Candidate for the Stack Technique?**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Naive Approach (O(n²)):**  \n",
    "   - For each day, you look backward until you find a day with a higher price. This can result in nested loops (for day \\(i\\), check days \\(i-1, i-2, \\dots\\)).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Key Cues / Characteristics:**\n",
    "   - We only need to look back until we find a day with a higher price than the current day’s price.\n",
    "   - The consecutive “span” suggests that once a price is overshadowed by a higher price, it is no longer relevant for future days.\n",
    "   - A *monotonic stack* (descending) can efficiently skip the days that are no longer relevant.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Stack Advantage (O(n)):**  \n",
    "   - Each day is pushed and popped at most once.  \n",
    "   - While the top of the stack has a price **less than or equal** to the current day’s price, pop it.  \n",
    "   - The stack’s top will then be the nearest day with a higher price.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Break Down → Stack Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Step-by-Step Sub-Tasks**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initialization:**\n",
    "   - Create an empty stack to store **indices** of days.\n",
    "   - Create an output array `span` of size \\(n\\).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Iterate Over Days (Left to Right):**\n",
    "   - For the current day \\(i\\):\n",
    "     1. **Pop** from the stack while it is not empty **and** the price at the top of the stack is **less than or equal** to the current day’s price.  \n",
    "     2. If the stack is **empty**, it means no previous day’s price is higher → `span[i] = i + 1`.  \n",
    "     3. Otherwise, the top of the stack is the index of the nearest higher price on the left → `span[i] = i - topIndex`.  \n",
    "     4. **Push** the current index \\(i\\) onto the stack.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Data Structures Used:**\n",
    "   - **Stack of Indices**:  \n",
    "     - The stack will store the indices of days in descending order of prices.\n",
    "   - **Array for Span**:  \n",
    "     - Stores the final span result for each day.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Explanations + Code\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Detailed Explanation of Each Step**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Stack Maintenance:**\n",
    "   - By maintaining a *descending order* of prices on the stack, we can quickly pop out any days whose prices are not relevant (i.e., less than or equal to current price).\n",
    "2. **Computing Span:**\n",
    "   - If the stack becomes empty, it means no higher price was found → the span extends all the way back to the first day.\n",
    "   - If the stack is not empty, the nearest higher day is on the top. The difference in indices gives the span.\n",
    "3. **Time Complexity:**\n",
    "   - Each day (index) is pushed and popped **at most once**.\n",
    "   - Hence, the overall time complexity is **O(n)**.\n",
