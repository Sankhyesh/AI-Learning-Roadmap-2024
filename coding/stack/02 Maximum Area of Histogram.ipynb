    "\n",
    "### **Problem Statement**\n",
    "\n",
    "We are given an array of non-negative integers representing the **heights** of bars in a histogram. Each bar has a **width** of 1. We need to find the **largest rectangular area** that can fit entirely under the histogram.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Input**\n",
    "\n",
    "- An integer \\(n\\), the number of bars in the histogram.\n",
    "- An array of \\(n\\) non-negative integers, e.g. \\([6, 2, 5, 4, 5, 1, 6]\\).\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Output**\n",
    "\n",
    "- A single integer representing the **maximum rectangular area** possible under the histogram.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Detailed Example**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Histogram Heights**:  \n",
    "\\[\n",
    "[6,\\, 2,\\, 5,\\, 4,\\, 5,\\, 1,\\, 6]\n",
    "\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "1. One possible rectangle is just the bar at index 0 (height = 6, width = 1) → area = \\(6 \\times 1 = 6\\).  \n",
    "2. Another rectangle might span indices \\([2, 3, 4]\\) with height = 4 (the smallest among 5, 4, 5) → width = 3 → area = \\(4 \\times 3 = 12\\).  \n",
    "3. We need to check all possible rectangles to find the one with the maximum area.  \n",
    "\n",
    "For this array, the **largest rectangle** has an area of **12** (from the bars with heights \\([5, 4, 5]\\) where the limiting height is 4 and the width is 3).\n",

    "## 2. Identification\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Why Use a Stack Technique?**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Naive Approach (O(\\(n^2\\))):**  \n",
    "   - We could try every possible pair of bars and compute the minimum height within that range, then multiply by the width. This leads to nested loops and O(\\(n^2\\)) complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Monotonic Stack Optimization (O(\\(n\\))):**  \n",
    "   - By finding the **Nearest Smaller to Left (NSL)** and **Nearest Smaller to Right (NSR)** for each bar, we can determine how far each bar can “expand” without encountering a smaller bar that would reduce the rectangle’s height.  \n",
    "   - Storing indices in a *monotonically increasing stack* allows each element to be pushed and popped at most once, giving us an O(\\(n\\)) solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Key Cues / Characteristics**:\n",
    "   - We are effectively looking for how far each bar can extend to the left and right before a bar of **smaller** height is encountered.\n",
    "   - This is precisely the “nearest smaller element” pattern.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Break Down → Stack Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Step-by-Step Sub-Tasks**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Compute Nearest Smaller to Left (NSL) indices for each bar**  \n",
    "   - For bar at index \\(i\\), find the index of the bar to the left which is **smaller**. If none exists, use a **pseudo-index** \\(-1\\).  \n",
    "   - Store these indices in a `left` array.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Compute Nearest Smaller to Right (NSR) indices for each bar**  \n",
    "   - For bar at index \\(i\\), find the index of the bar to the right which is **smaller**. If none exists, use a **pseudo-index** \\(n\\).  \n",
    "   - Store these indices in a `right` array.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Calculate the width for each bar**  \n",
    "   - The bar at index \\(i\\) can extend from `(left[i] + 1)` to `(right[i] - 1)`.  \n",
    "   - Hence, **width** = `right[i] - left[i] - 1`.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Compute the area for each bar**  \n",
    "   - **area[i]** = `height[i] * width[i]`.  \n",
    "   - Keep track of the maximum area encountered.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Data Structures Used**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Two Stacks (or repeated usage of one stack)**:\n",
    "  - One stack to compute NSL (traversing from left to right).\n",
    "  - Another (or re-initialized) stack to compute NSR (traversing from right to left).\n",
    "- **Arrays**:\n",
    "  - `left[]` to store the nearest smaller to left indices.\n",
    "  - `right[]` to store the nearest smaller to right indices.\n",
    "  - `width[]` and an integer for max area calculation.\n",

    "## 4. Explanations + Code\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Detailed Explanation of Each Step**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Nearest Smaller to Left (NSL)**  \n",
    "   - Traverse the histogram from **left to right**.  \n",
    "   - Maintain a **monotonically increasing** stack of bar indices.  \n",
    "   - For the current bar \\(i\\), pop from the stack while the top bar is **greater or equal** in height.  \n",
    "   - If the stack becomes empty, `left[i] = -1`; otherwise, `left[i] = stack.top()`.  \n",
    "   - Push the current index \\(i\\).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Nearest Smaller to Right (NSR)**  \n",
    "   - Traverse the histogram from **right to left**.  \n",
    "   - Maintain the same **monotonically increasing** principle (pop while top bar is **greater or equal**).  \n",
    "   - If empty, `right[i] = n`; else `right[i] = stack.top()`.  \n",
    "   - Push the current index \\(i\\).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Calculate Width and Area**  \n",
    "   - For each bar \\(i\\),  \n",
    "     \\[\n",
    "       \\text{width}[i] = (\\text{right}[i]) - (\\text{left}[i]) - 1\n",
    "     \\]  \n",
    "   - \\(\\text{area}[i] = \\text{height}[i] \\times \\text{width}[i]\\).  \n",
    "   - Track `max_area = max(max_area, area[i])`.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Time Complexity**  \n",
    "   - Each bar is pushed and popped at most once in both NSL and NSR passes.  \n",
    "   - Hence, overall time complexity is **O(\\(n\\))**.\n",
