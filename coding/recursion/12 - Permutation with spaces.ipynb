    "# Comprehensive Handout for Permutation with Spaces\n",
    "\n",
    "In this problem, you are given a string, and your goal is to generate all possible strings formed by inserting a space between adjacent characters. For example, if the input is `\"ABC\"`, you need to generate every variation where a space may or may not be inserted between each pair of characters.\n",

    "## 1. IP–OP–PS (Input, Output, Problem Statement)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem Statement\n",
    "Given a string of length *n*, generate and print all permutations of the string by inserting a space (or not) between every two adjacent characters.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Input\n",
    "- **String:** A non-empty string, e.g., `\"ABC\"`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Output\n",
    "- **Permutations with Spaces:** All possible strings obtained by optionally inserting a space between adjacent characters.  \n",
    "  For a string of length *n*, there are 2ⁿ⁻¹ possible outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Detailed Example\n",
    "For example, if the input is:\n",
    "```plaintext\n",
    "Input: \"ABC\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "Then, there are 2² = 4 possible outputs:\n",
    "```plaintext\n",
    "\"ABC\"     (no spaces)\n",
    "\"A BC\"    (space between A and B)\n",
    "\"AB C\"    (space between B and C)\n",
    "\"A B C\"   (spaces between both A & B and B & C)\n",

    "## 2. Identification\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Is This Problem a Candidate for Recursion?\n",
    "- **Binary Decision at Each Gap:**  \n",
    "  There are *n – 1* positions between characters. At each gap, you decide whether to insert a space or not.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Exponential Possibilities:**  \n",
    "  Since each of the *n – 1* positions offers two choices, the total number of possibilities is 2ⁿ⁻¹, which fits naturally into a recursive (backtracking) solution.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Natural Recursive Structure:**  \n",
    "  You can build the solution by starting with the first character and then, for every subsequent character, recursively decide to either append it directly or append a space before it.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Breakdown → Recursive Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step-by-Step Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initialization:**\n",
    "   - Begin with the first character of the input string.\n",
    "   - The recursion starts from index 1 (the second character).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Base Case:**\n",
    "   - If the current index equals the length of the string, the built string is complete; print (or record) this permutation.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Recursive Case:**\n",
    "   - **Option 1:** Append the current character directly to the output string.\n",
    "   - **Option 2:** Append a space followed by the current character.\n",
    "   - Recursively call the function for the next index in both cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Data Structures:**\n",
    "   - **Input String:** The original string.\n",
    "   - **Output String:** A temporary string that holds the current permutation.\n",
    "   - **Call Stack:** Used naturally for recursion.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Explanations + Code\n",
    "\n",
    "### Detailed Explanation\n",
    "- **Recursion Setup:**  \n",
    "  Start with the first character of the string. For every subsequent character, you have two choices:\n",
    "  1. **No Space:** Append the character directly.\n",
    "  2. **Insert Space:** Append a space, then the character.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Base Case:**  \n",
    "  When you have processed all characters (i.e. the current index equals the string length), print or store the current permutation.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Time Complexity:**  \n",
    "  There are 2ⁿ⁻¹ recursive calls in the worst case (with *n* being the length of the string).\n",
    "\n",

    "    \n",
    "    // Option 2: Append a space and then the current character\n",
    "    // (Only add space if not at the end; this ensures no trailing space)\n",

    "  \n",
    "- **Recursive Calls:**  \n",
    "  For each character at index *i*, the function makes two recursive calls: one that appends the character directly, and one that appends a space followed by the character.\n",
