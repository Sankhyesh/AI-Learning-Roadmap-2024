    "# Comprehensive Handout for Tower of Hanoi (Recursion)\n",
    "\n",
    "This handout explains the Tower of Hanoi problem and illustrates its recursive solution using a 4‐step flow: IP–OP–PS, Identification, Breakdown, and Explanations + Code. An animated visualization is also provided to help you see the algorithm’s process.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. IP–OP–PS (Input, Output, Problem Statement)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem Statement\n",
    "The Tower of Hanoi is a classic puzzle that involves moving a stack of disks from one rod to another while obeying the following rules:\n",
    "- Only one disk may be moved at a time.\n",
    "- A disk is slid off the top of one rod onto another rod.\n",
    "- A larger disk may never be placed on top of a smaller disk.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Input\n",
    "- **n:** The number of disks (a positive integer).\n",
    "- **Rods:** Three rods named **Source (A)**, **Auxiliary (B)**, and **Destination (C)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Output\n",
    "- **Sequence of Moves:** A list of moves that describe how to transfer all `n` disks from the source rod to the destination rod following the rules.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Detailed Example\n",
    "For example, given **n = 3**, a possible output is:\n",
    "```plaintext\n",
    "Move disk 1 from A to C\n",
    "Move disk 2 from A to B\n",
    "Move disk 1 from C to B\n",
    "Move disk 3 from A to C\n",
    "Move disk 1 from B to A\n",
    "Move disk 2 from B to C\n",
    "Move disk 1 from A to C\n",
    "```\n",
    "Each step adheres to the rules, and after these moves, all disks are transferred from rod A to rod C.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Identification\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Is This Problem a Candidate for Recursion?\n",
    "- **Self-Similar Structure:** The Tower of Hanoi problem exhibits the same structure at every level—moving `n` disks can be broken down into moving `n-1` disks.\n",
    "- **Base Case and Recursive Case:** When there is only one disk (base case), the solution is trivial. For more than one disk, the solution involves recursively moving a smaller stack.\n",
    "- **Natural Recursive Decomposition:** The process of moving disks from one rod to another is naturally described by recursive calls:\n",
    "  1. Move `n-1` disks from the source to the auxiliary rod.\n",
    "  2. Move the largest disk to the destination.\n",
    "  3. Move the `n-1` disks from the auxiliary to the destination.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Breakdown → Recursion\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step-by-Step Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Base Case:**\n",
    "   - **If `n == 1`:** Simply move the disk directly from the source to the destination.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Recursive Case:**\n",
    "   - **Step 1:** Recursively move the top `n-1` disks from the source rod to the auxiliary rod using the destination rod as temporary storage.\n",
    "   - **Step 2:** Move the largest disk (nth disk) from the source rod to the destination rod.\n",
    "   - **Step 3:** Recursively move the `n-1` disks from the auxiliary rod to the destination rod using the source rod as temporary storage.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Initialization & Data Structures:**\n",
    "   - No special data structures are required; the recursion is managed via the call stack.\n",
    "   - The algorithm prints or records each move during its execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Time Complexity:**\n",
    "   - The solution makes **2ⁿ – 1** moves, resulting in an exponential time complexity **O(2ⁿ)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Explanations + Code\n",
    "\n",
    "### Detailed Explanation\n",
    "The recursive solution divides the problem into smaller sub-problems by moving `n-1` disks around. For each recursive call:\n",
    "- The algorithm moves the top `n-1` disks to the auxiliary rod.\n",
    "- Then it moves the largest disk.\n",
    "- Finally, it moves the `n-1` disks from the auxiliary rod to the destination rod.\n",
    "\n",
    "### C++ Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "```cpp\n",
    "#include <iostream>\n",
    "using namespace std;\n",
    "\n",
    "// Recursive function to solve Tower of Hanoi problem\n",
    "void towerOfHanoi(int n, char source, char auxiliary, char destination) {\n",
    "    if (n == 1) {\n",
    "        cout << \"Move disk 1 from \" << source << \" to \" << destination << endl;\n",
    "        return;\n",
    "    }\n",
    "    // Move top n-1 disks from source to auxiliary\n",
    "    towerOfHanoi(n - 1, source, destination, auxiliary);\n",
    "    \n",
    "    // Move remaining disk from source to destination\n",
    "    cout << \"Move disk \" << n << \" from \" << source << \" to \" << destination << endl;\n",
    "    \n",
    "    // Move the n-1 disks from auxiliary to destination\n",
    "    towerOfHanoi(n - 1, auxiliary, source, destination);\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "int main() {\n",
    "    int n = 3;  // Example: 3 disks\n",
    "    cout << \"Sequence of moves for \" << n << \" disks:\" << endl;\n",
    "    towerOfHanoi(n, 'A', 'B', 'C');\n",
    "    return 0;\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Code Explanation:**\n",
    "- **Base Case:** When `n == 1`, the disk is moved directly.\n",
    "- **Recursive Case:** The function calls itself to move `n-1` disks around before and after moving the largest disk.\n",
    "- **Time Complexity:** The algorithm runs in O(2ⁿ) time because it requires 2ⁿ – 1 moves.\n",
