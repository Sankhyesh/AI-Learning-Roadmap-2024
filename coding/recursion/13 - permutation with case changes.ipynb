    "# Comprehensive Handout for Permutation with Case Change (Recursion)\n",
    "\n",
    "In this problem, you are given a string and must generate all possible strings by toggling the case of every alphabetic character. Non-alphabetic characters remain unchanged. For example, given `\"a1b\"`, the output should include `\"a1b\"`, `\"a1B\"`, `\"A1b\"`, and `\"A1B\"`.\n",

    "## 1. IP–OP–PS (Input, Output, Problem Statement)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem Statement\n",
    "Given a string, generate and print all possible permutations where the case of each letter can be either lowercase or uppercase. The order of characters remains the same, but for every alphabetic character, you choose its lowercase or uppercase version.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Input\n",
    "- **String:** A non-empty string (e.g., `\"a1b\"`).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Output\n",
    "- **Permutations with Case Change:** All possible variations of the string with every alphabetic character toggled between lowercase and uppercase.  \n",
    "  For a string with *n* alphabetic characters, there will be 2ⁿ outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Detailed Example\n",
    "For example, if the input is:\n",
    "```plaintext\n",
    "Input: \"a1b\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "Then the possible outputs are:\n",
    "```plaintext\n",
    "\"a1b\"  (both letters in lowercase)\n",
    "\"a1B\"  (first letter lowercase, second letter uppercase)\n",
    "\"A1b\"  (first letter uppercase, second letter lowercase)\n",
    "\"A1B\"  (both letters in uppercase)\n",

    "## 2. Identification\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Is This Problem a Candidate for Recursion?\n",
    "- **Binary Decision at Each Character:**  \n",
    "  For each alphabetic character, there are two choices: use its lowercase version or its uppercase version. This leads naturally to a binary decision tree.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Exponential Possibilities:**  \n",
    "  If there are *k* alphabetic characters, there are 2ᵏ possible combinations. Recursion handles this exponential branching in an elegant way.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Natural Recursive Structure:**  \n",
    "  The problem can be broken down character by character. Once you decide the case for the current character, you move on to the next character recursively.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Cues\n",
    "- The task involves toggling the case of characters.\n",
    "- Each decision is independent and binary (lowercase or uppercase).\n",
    "- A recursive function can easily process the string one character at a time.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Breakdown → Recursive Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step-by-Step Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initialization:**\n",
    "   - Start with an empty output string.\n",
    "   - Begin processing the input string from index 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Base Case:**\n",
    "   - If the current index equals the length of the string, the output string is complete. Print or record this permutation.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Recursive Case:**\n",
    "   - **For an Alphabetic Character:**\n",
    "     - **Option 1:** Append its lowercase form and recursively process the next character.\n",
    "     - **Option 2:** Append its uppercase form and recursively process the next character.\n",
    "   - **For a Non-Alphabetic Character:**\n",
    "     - Append it as is and continue with the recursion.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Data Structures:**\n",
    "   - **Input String:** The original string.\n",
    "   - **Output String:** A temporary string that holds the current permutation.\n",
    "   - **Call Stack:** The recursion naturally uses the call stack to explore all possibilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Explanations + Code\n",
    "\n",
    "### Detailed Explanation\n",
    "- **Recursive Function:**  \n",
    "  The function processes one character at a time. When an alphabetic character is encountered, it branches into two recursive calls: one for the lowercase and one for the uppercase version.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Base Case:**  \n",
    "  Once every character has been processed (i.e. the current index equals the string length), the function prints or stores the current permutation.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Time Complexity:**  \n",
    "  If there are *k* alphabetic characters, the time complexity is O(2ᵏ). Non-alphabetic characters add only a constant time per character.\n",
