    "# Reverse a Stack Using Recursion\n",
    "\n",
    "This handout explains how to reverse a stack using recursion. The approach is broken down into four steps—IP–OP–PS, Identification, Breakdown, and Explanations + Code—while also incorporating the intuitive concepts from the video explanation (without including the transcript). The ideas focus on using induction-like reasoning, peeling off elements, and then reinserting them at the bottom.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. IP–OP–PS (Input, Output, Problem Statement)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1 Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a stack of elements, reverse the order of the stack **using recursion only**.  \n",
    "**Constraints:**\n",
    "- No loops may be used.\n",
    "- No auxiliary data structures (like another stack or an array) are allowed.\n",
    "- The reversal must be achieved solely with recursion (utilizing the call stack).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2 Input\n",
    "\n",
    "- A stack `S` containing elements (for example, integers).  \n",
    "  **Example:**\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "  S: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "  where `1` is at the bottom and `5` is at the top.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.3 Output\n",
    "\n",
    "- The same stack `S`, but with its elements in reversed order.  \n",
    "  **Example:**\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "  S (reversed): [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.4 Example\n",
    "\n",
    "**Input:**  \n",
    "```\n",
    "Stack S: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Output:**  \n",
    "```\n",
    "Stack S (reversed): [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Identification\n",
    "\n",
    "This problem is an excellent candidate for a recursive solution because:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Inductive Reasoning:**  \n",
    "  Just as the video explained, the problem can be approached by establishing a base case (an empty stack or a stack with one element) and then assuming that reversing a smaller stack works. Each recursive step “peels off” the top element, reduces the problem size, and later reinserts the element at the bottom.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Divide and Conquer:**  \n",
    "  The process involves dividing the problem: first, remove an element; then, reverse the smaller stack; finally, combine the result by inserting the removed element at the bottom. This mirrors the induction process highlighted in the video.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **No Extra Storage:**  \n",
    "  The solution leverages the system’s call stack to hold intermediate results, keeping the implementation elegant and concise—another point emphasized in the video.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Breakdown of the Recursive Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "The solution is divided into two primary recursive functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **`reverseStack(stack)`**\n",
    "   - **Base Case:**  \n",
    "     If the stack is empty, simply return.\n",
    "   - **Recursive Step:**  \n",
    "     - Pop the top element from the stack.\n",
    "     - Recursively call `reverseStack` on the remaining stack.\n",
    "     - Insert the popped element at the bottom using a helper function.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **`insertAtBottom(stack, element)`**\n",
    "   - **Base Case:**  \n",
    "     If the stack is empty, push the element onto it.\n",
    "   - **Recursive Step:**  \n",
    "     - Pop the top element.\n",
    "     - Recursively call `insertAtBottom` to insert the element at the bottom.\n",
    "     - Push the popped element back onto the stack.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Concepts from the Video Explanation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Peeling Off Elements:**  \n",
    "  Think of the process like peeling an onion—remove one layer (element) at a time until you reach the core (base case), then rebuild the stack in reverse order.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Inductive Strategy:**  \n",
    "  Start with a simple base condition (empty stack), and then assume that the process works for a smaller stack. Use this assumption to correctly insert each removed element at the bottom.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Recursive Reassembly:**  \n",
    "  After reaching the base case, each recursive call completes by reassembling the stack so that the removed element is placed at the bottom, effectively reversing the order.\n",
    "\n",

    "## 4. Explanations + Code\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.1 Detailed Explanation\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Reverse the Stack (`reverseStack`):**\n",
    "   - **Remove the Top Element:**  \n",
    "     Pop the top element and store it.\n",
    "   - **Recursively Process the Remaining Stack:**  \n",
    "     Call `reverseStack` on the stack that now has one fewer element.\n",
    "   - **Insert at the Bottom:**  \n",
    "     Once the smaller stack is reversed, use `insertAtBottom` to place the stored element at the bottom of the stack.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Insert at Bottom (`insertAtBottom`):**\n",
    "   - **Base Case:**  \n",
    "     If the stack is empty, push the element as it becomes the bottom element.\n",
    "   - **Recursive Process:**  \n",
    "     Remove the top element, recursively call `insertAtBottom` to insert the target element at the bottom, then push the removed element back to restore the order.\n",
