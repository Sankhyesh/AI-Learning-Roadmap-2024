    "# Comprehensive Handout for Printing Unique Subsets and Variations\n",
    "\n",
    "This handout explains how to generate all unique subsets (i.e. the power set) of a given collection that may contain duplicates. Variations of the problem can include printing unique subsequences of a string or obtaining the subsets in lexicographical order.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. IP–OP–PS (Input, Output, Problem Statement)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem Statement\n",
    "Given an array (or string) that may contain duplicate elements, generate and print all unique subsets.  \n",
    "For example, for an input array, duplicate elements should not lead to duplicate subsets in the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Input\n",
    "- **Collection:** An array of integers (or characters) that can contain duplicates, e.g., `[1, 2, 2]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Output\n",
    "- **Unique Subsets:** A list of all distinct subsets (including the empty set).  \n",
    "  For a collection with *n* elements, there will be at most 2ⁿ subsets—but fewer if duplicates exist.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Detailed Example\n",
    "For example, if the input is:\n",
    "```plaintext\n",
    "Input: [1, 2, 2]\n",
    "```\n",
    "The unique subsets (one possible order) are:\n",
    "```plaintext\n",
    "[]\n",
    "[1]\n",
    "[2]\n",
    "[1,2]\n",
    "[2,2]\n",
    "[1,2,2]\n",
    "```\n",
    "*Note:* The order may vary. A common variation is to output these in lexicographical (sorted) order.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Identification\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Is This Problem a Candidate for a Recursive (Backtracking) Approach?\n",
    "- **Binary Decision Making:**  \n",
    "  Each element can either be included or excluded. With duplicates present, you must decide to skip over repeated elements when needed.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Avoiding Duplicates:**  \n",
    "  Sorting the input enables you to easily detect and skip duplicate elements during recursion.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Natural Recursive Structure:**  \n",
    "  Generating subsets naturally breaks down into a decision at each index: include the current element or skip it. This decision tree is effectively traversed using recursion.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Cues\n",
    "- The need to explore all combinations.\n",
    "- Input may have duplicates, requiring careful handling (usually by sorting).\n",
    "- Variations may ask for outputs in lexicographical order.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Breakdown → Recursive Backtracking\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step-by-Step Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Sort the Input:**\n",
    "   - Sorting ensures that duplicates are adjacent. This simplifies the process of skipping over duplicate choices.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Base Case:**\n",
    "   - When the current index reaches the length of the input, the current subset (which might be empty) is complete and should be recorded/printed.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Recursive Case:**\n",
    "   - **Exclude the Current Element:**  \n",
    "     Make a recursive call without including the current element.\n",
    "   - **Include the Current Element:**  \n",
    "     Append the current element to the current subset and then recursively call for the next index.\n",
    "   - **Skip Duplicates:**  \n",
    "     When processing duplicates, if an element is the same as the previous element and it wasn’t chosen at this recursion level, skip it to avoid duplicate subsets.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Data Structures:**\n",
    "   - **Input Array:** The sorted collection.\n",
    "   - **Current Subset:** A temporary container (e.g., vector) holding the current combination.\n",
    "   - **Result Storage:** A container (e.g., vector of vectors) to store all unique subsets.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Variations:**\n",
    "   - **Lexicographical Order:**  \n",
    "     With the sorted input, the recursive method inherently produces subsets in lexicographical order.\n",
    "   - **Alternate Data Types:**  \n",
    "     The approach can be adapted to strings or other comparable data types.\n",
    "\n",

    "## 4. Explanations + Code\n",
    "\n",
    "### Detailed Explanation\n",
    "- **Recursive Function:**  \n",
    "  The function iterates over the elements starting at a given index. For each element, it recursively explores both including and excluding that element.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Skipping Duplicates:**  \n",
    "  If the current element is the same as the previous element (and it’s not the first element in the current recursion level), the algorithm skips it to ensure that each subset is generated only once.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Time Complexity:**  \n",
    "  In the worst case (all elements unique), the number of subsets is 2ⁿ. With duplicates, the actual count is lower, but the recursion still explores an exponential number of branches in the worst case.\n",
