    "# Comprehensive Handout: N-bit Binary Numbers with More 1’s than 0’s in Every Prefix\n",
    "\n",
    "In this problem, you are given an integer *n* representing the number of bits. You need to generate all binary strings of length *n* where, for every prefix of the string, the number of 1’s is strictly greater than the number of 0’s. This condition forces the string to always start with a 1 and, when adding a 0, ensures that it does not “overpower” the 1’s accumulated so far.\n",

    "## 1. IP–OP–PS (Input, Output, Problem Statement)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem Statement\n",
    "Generate and print all N‑bit binary strings such that for every prefix of the string, the count of 1’s is greater than the count of 0’s.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Input\n",
    "- **n:** An integer representing the total number of bits in the binary string.  \n",
    "  *(For example, n = 3)*\n",
    "\n",
    "### Output\n",
    "- **Binary Strings:** All valid binary strings of length *n* that satisfy the condition that every prefix has more 1’s than 0’s.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Detailed Example\n",
    "For **n = 3**, the valid binary strings are:\n",
    "- `\"111\"`  \n",
    "  *Prefixes: \"1\" (1>0), \"11\" (2>0), \"111\" (3>0).*\n",
    "- `\"110\"`  \n",
    "  *Prefixes: \"1\" (1>0), \"11\" (2>0), \"110\" (2>1).*\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that a string like `\"101\"` is not valid because the prefix `\"10\"` has an equal number of 1’s and 0’s (1 == 1).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Identification\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Is This Problem a Candidate for Recursion (Backtracking)?\n",
    "- **Binary Decision at Each Position:**  \n",
    "  For every bit (except the very first, which must be 1), you have two choices—append a `1` or a `0`.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Maintaining a Valid Prefix:**  \n",
    "  The condition that the number of 1’s must always exceed the number of 0’s is similar to the balanced parentheses problem. Before appending a `0`, you must check that doing so will not violate the invariant.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Exponential Possibilities with Pruning:**  \n",
    "  Although there are 2ⁿ possible strings in total, you can prune many branches early by enforcing the condition (e.g., you cannot start with a `0` or add a `0` when the number of 1’s is not at least two more than the number of 0’s).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Breakdown → Recursive Backtracking Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step-by-Step Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initialization:**\n",
    "   - Start with an empty string.\n",
    "   - Use two counters:  \n",
    "     - **ones:** Number of 1’s added so far.\n",
    "     - **zeros:** Number of 0’s added so far.\n",
    "   - Since the first bit must be a `1` (otherwise the very first prefix fails the condition), begin with `current = \"1\"`, `ones = 1`, and `zeros = 0`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Base Case:**\n",
    "   - When the length of the current string equals *n*, the string is complete. Append the string to the result.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Recursive Case:**\n",
    "   - **Option 1 – Append '1':**  \n",
    "     Always allowed. Increase `ones` by 1 and make a recursive call.\n",
    "   - **Option 2 – Append '0':**  \n",
    "     Only allowed if adding a `0` will keep the invariant true. That is, you can append `0` only if `ones > zeros + 1` (so that after adding `0`, the count of 1’s remains strictly greater than the count of 0’s).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Data Structures:**\n",
    "   - **Input:** The integer *n* and the original string (implicitly, since we build it up).\n",
    "   - **Output:** A vector (or list) of strings containing all valid binary numbers.\n",
    "   - **Call Stack:** Used by the recursive function to maintain state (current string, ones, zeros).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Explanations + Code\n",
    "\n",
    "### Detailed Explanation\n",
    "The recursive function processes the binary string one bit at a time.  \n",
    "- **Adding '1':** This branch is always safe as it only increases the count of 1’s.\n",
    "- **Adding '0':** This branch is only taken if doing so maintains the invariant. For example, if the current string is `\"11\"` (ones = 2, zeros = 0), you can add a `0` because 2 > 0 + 1.\n",
    "- **Base Case:** When the string reaches length *n*, it is output as a valid string.\n",
