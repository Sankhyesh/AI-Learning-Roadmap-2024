    "## 1. IP – OP – PS (Input, Output, Problem Statement)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem Statement Example Used\n",
    "Generate all subsequences of a given string.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Input Example\n",
    "A string, for example: `\"abc\"`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Output Example\n",
    "All possible subsequences of the input string:\n",
    "- `\"\"` (the empty subsequence)\n",
    "- `\"a\"`\n",
    "- `\"b\"`\n",
    "- `\"c\"`\n",
    "- `\"ab\"`\n",
    "- `\"ac\"`\n",
    "- `\"bc\"`\n",
    "- `\"abc\"`\n",
    "\n",
    "### General Concept\n",
    "Recursion applies to problems that can be broken down into smaller, self-similar instances. In this example, each character in the string presents a **choice**: to include it in the subsequence or not. This decision-making process naturally leads to smaller instances of the same problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Identification (Why Recursion?)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why It's a Candidate for Recursion\n",
    "- **Decision Making:** At each step, you decide whether to include or exclude the current character.\n",
    "- **Self-Similarity:** Each decision leads to a smaller instance of the original problem (e.g., generating subsequences for the remaining substring).\n",
    "- **Automatic Input Reduction:** The input shrinks as a consequence of making these decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Cues/Characteristics\n",
    "- **Exploring Possibilities:** Problems where you explore multiple possibilities (include/exclude, choose/not choose) are ideal for recursion.\n",
    "- **Recursive Tree Structure:** The problem can be visualized as a tree where each node represents a state with a given input and an output built so far.\n",
    "- **Input-Output Method:** At each node, you track the remaining input and the output constructed to that point, which mirrors the recursive process.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Break Down → Recursion (The Process)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step-by-Step Sub-Tasks (General Recursive Flow)\n",
    "1. **Base Case:**  \n",
    "   - Identify the simplest possible input where the answer is known.  \n",
    "   - *Example:* When the input string is empty, the only subsequence is the empty string.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Decision/Choice:**  \n",
    "   - At the current step, decide whether to include the current character in the subsequence or exclude it.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Recursive Call:**  \n",
    "   - For each decision made, call the same function recursively with:\n",
    "     - **Modified Input:** The remaining substring (a smaller input).\n",
    "     - **Updated Output:** The current subsequence built so far.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Initialization\n",
    "- Start with the original input string and an initial output state (usually an empty subsequence).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Iterative Update\n",
    "- The recursive call automatically updates the state:\n",
    "  - The input becomes smaller.\n",
    "  - The output accumulates characters based on the decisions taken.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Structures\n",
    "- **Call Stack:** Manages the recursive calls.\n",
    "- **Auxiliary Structure:** A string or list to build and store the subsequences.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Explanations + Code\n",
    "\n",
    "### Detailed Explanation\n",
    "- **Recursive Tree:**  \n",
    "  Visualize the process as a tree where each node represents a state defined by the remaining input and the current output (subsequence).  \n",
    "  - **Nodes:** Current state (input remaining and output built so far).\n",
    "  - **Branches:** Decisions made (include or exclude the current character).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Input-Output Method:**  \n",
    "  At each recursive call:\n",
    "  - **Input:** The remaining part of the string.\n",
    "  - **Output:** The subsequence built so far.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  The function makes a decision, which naturally reduces the input. The recursion stops when the input is empty (base case).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Time Complexity:**  \n",
    "  - For generating all subsequences, the time complexity is **O(2^n)** because every character results in two choices (include or exclude).\n",
    "\n",
