    "# Comprehensive Handout for Printing All Subsets (PowerSet / Subsequences)\n",
    "\n",
    "This handout explains the problem of printing all subsets (also known as the PowerSet or all subsequences) of a given set (or string/array). The solution is based on a recursive approach where, at each step, you decide whether to include or exclude an element.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. IP–OP–PS (Input, Output, Problem Statement)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem Statement\n",
    "Given a set (or string/array) of elements, generate and print all possible subsets (i.e., the power set). This includes the empty set as well as the set itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Input\n",
    "- **Set (or String/Array):** A collection of elements, e.g., a string `\"abc\"` or an array `[a, b, c]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Output\n",
    "- **Subsets:** A list of all possible subsets. For a set with *n* elements, there will be 2ⁿ subsets.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Detailed Example\n",
    "For example, if the input is:\n",
    "```plaintext\n",
    "Input: \"abc\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "The output (all subsets) will be:\n",
    "```plaintext\n",
    "\"\"       (the empty set)\n",
    "\"a\"\n",
    "\"b\"\n",
    "\"c\"\n",
    "\"ab\"\n",
    "\"ac\"\n",
    "\"bc\"\n",
    "\"abc\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "Each subset is obtained by choosing whether or not to include each element from the input.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Identification\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Is This Problem a Candidate for Recursion?\n",
    "- **Self-Similar Structure:** The problem can be broken down into smaller subproblems; generating subsets of a set with *n* elements can be viewed as generating subsets of the first *n-1* elements, then appending or not appending the nth element.\n",
    "- **Binary Decision at Each Step:** For each element, you have exactly two choices: include it or exclude it. This leads naturally to a recursive tree structure.\n",
    "- **Exponential Output:** Even though there are 2ⁿ subsets, recursion efficiently explores the decision space without redundant computations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Cues\n",
    "- The need to explore all combinations or subsequences.\n",
    "- The problem involves making binary decisions repeatedly.\n",
    "- It has a clear base case when no more elements are left to decide.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Breakdown → Recursive Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step-by-Step Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Base Case:**\n",
    "   - If there are no more elements left to process (i.e., the current index reaches the length of the input), print (or store) the current subset.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Recursive Case:**\n",
    "   - **Exclude the Current Element:** Recursively generate subsets without including the element at the current index.\n",
    "   - **Include the Current Element:** Recursively generate subsets including the element at the current index (append it to the current subset).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Initialization & Data Structures:**\n",
    "   - Use a recursive function with parameters for the input, current index, and the current subset (string or list).\n",
    "   - No special data structures are needed aside from the call stack and a temporary container to hold the current subset.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Final Output:**\n",
    "   - After all recursive calls, all possible subsets have been generated and printed.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Explanations + Code\n",
    "\n",
    "### Detailed Explanation\n",
    "- **Recursive Function:**  \n",
    "  The recursive function takes the current index and the subset built so far. When the index equals the length of the input, the current subset is a complete subset and is printed.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Binary Decision:**  \n",
    "  At each step, you decide:\n",
    "  1. **Do not include** the current element.\n",
    "  2. **Include** the current element.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Time Complexity:**  \n",
    "  The algorithm explores 2ⁿ possibilities (each element has two choices), so its time complexity is **O(2ⁿ)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### C++ Implementation\n",

    "    \n",
    "    // 2. Include the current element and move to the next element\n",

    "    printSubsets(input, 0, \"\");\n",
    "    return 0;\n",
    "}\n",

    "\n",
    "**Code Explanation:**\n",
    "- **Base Case:**  \n",
    "  When the index is equal to the length of the input string, the function prints the current subset.\n",
    "- **Recursive Calls:**  \n",
    "  One recursive call is made by excluding the current element, and another by including it.\n",
    "- **Time Complexity:**  \n",
    "  Since each element has two choices, the total number of subsets is 2ⁿ, resulting in O(2ⁿ) time complexity.\n",
