    "# Kth Symbol in Grammar\n",
    "\n",
    "This handout explains the **Kth Symbol in Grammar** problem by combining a clear four-step flow with the conceptual insights from a detailed video transcript. Although the transcript was originally in another language, we have distilled its core ideas into a comprehensive explanation in English. The transcript emphasized breaking down the problem into input/output analysis, dividing the problem, inductively reasoning through the solution, and reassembling the result using a recursive strategy.\n",

    "## 1. Problem Statement (Input/Output)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1 Problem Description\n",
    "\n",
    "We start with a special grammar defined as follows:\n",
    "- **Row 1:** `\"0\"`\n",
    "- For each subsequent row, form the new row by appending the bitwise complement of the previous row. For example:\n",
    "  - **Row 2:** `\"0\"` becomes `\"0 1\"` (complement of 0 is 1)\n",
    "  - **Row 3:** `\"0 1\"` becomes `\"0 1 1 0\"` (complement of 0 1 is 1 0)\n",
    "  - **Row 4:** `\"0 1 1 0\"` becomes `\"0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1\"`\n",
    "\n",
    "The task is to determine the **Kth symbol** (1-indexed) in the **Nth row**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2 Input\n",
    "\n",
    "- Two integers:\n",
    "  - **N:** the row number (starting from 1)\n",
    "  - **K:** the position within that row (starting from 1)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.3 Output\n",
    "\n",
    "- A single integer, either `0` or `1`, which is the Kth symbol in the Nth row.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**  \n",
    "If **N = 4** and **K = 5**, the fourth row is:  \n",
    "```\n",
    "0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1\n",
    "```\n",
    "The 5th symbol in this row is `1`.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Identification and Conceptual Breakdown\n",
    "\n",
    "The video transcript provided a detailed, step-by-step explanation with several key ideas:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Input-Output Analysis:**  \n",
    "  The problem is clearly broken down into its input (N and K) and its desired output (a single bit).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Divide and Conquer:**  \n",
    "  The explanation stressed the importance of dividing the problem. Each row is constructed by taking the previous row and appending its complement. This means the problem naturally splits into two halves:\n",
    "  - The **first half** of row N is identical to row N–1.\n",
    "  - The **second half** is the complement of row N–1.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Inductive Reasoning:**  \n",
    "  The solution relies on the idea that if you can solve the problem for a smaller row, you can build up to a larger row. In other words, the problem is solved by reducing N until you reach the base case (N = 1).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Reassembly of the Result:**  \n",
    "  Once the smaller subproblem is solved, the answer is “mapped back” to the original problem. If the Kth symbol lies in the second half, the answer is the complement of the corresponding symbol in the first half.\n",
    "\n",
    "These insights guide our recursive solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Recursive Breakdown\n",
    "\n",
    "The recursive strategy for solving the problem is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Base Case:**  \n",
    "   - If **N = 1**, the only symbol is `0`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Recursive Case:**\n",
    "   - Calculate the length of the Nth row, which is \\(2^{(N-1)}\\).  \n",
    "   - Compute the midpoint \\( m = 2^{(N-2)} \\) (the number of symbols in the first half of the row).\n",
    "   - **If \\( K \\leq m \\):**  \n",
    "     The Kth symbol in row N is the same as the Kth symbol in row N–1.\n",
    "   - **If \\( K > m \\):**  \n",
    "     The Kth symbol is the complement of the \\((K - m)\\)th symbol in row N–1.\n",
    "\n",
    "This “divide, solve, and reassemble” approach is directly inspired by the transcript’s emphasis on carefully analyzing the input, dividing the work, and mapping the results back.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "## Inductive Reasoning for the Kth Symbol in Grammar Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "### Base Case\n",
    "- **Row 1**: The only symbol is `0`.  \n",
    "  Thus, if **N = 1** (and K = 1), the answer is `0`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Inductive Hypothesis\n",
    "- **Assumption:**  \n",
    "  Assume that for some row **N – 1**, we can correctly determine the kth symbol for any valid position.  \n",
    "  That is, for every valid \\( K \\) in row \\( N-1 \\), the function `kthSymbolGrammar(N-1, K)` returns the correct symbol.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Inductive Step\n",
    "- **For Row N:**\n",
    "  - The length of row \\( N \\) is \\( 2^{(N-1)} \\).\n",
    "  - Let the midpoint \\( m = 2^{(N-2)} \\), which divides the row into two halves.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Observations:**\n",
    "  - The **first half** of row \\( N \\) (positions \\( 1 \\) to \\( m \\)) is exactly the same as row \\( N-1 \\).\n",
    "  - The **second half** of row \\( N \\) (positions \\( m+1 \\) to \\( 2^{(N-1)} \\)) is the bitwise complement of row \\( N-1 \\).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Then:**\n",
    "  - **If \\( K \\leq m \\):**  \n",
    "    The kth symbol in row \\( N \\) is the same as the kth symbol in row \\( N-1 \\).  \n",
    "    Formally,  \n",
    "    \\[\n",
    "    kthSymbolGrammar(N, K) = kthSymbolGrammar(N-1, K)\n",
    "    \\]\n",
    "  \n",
    "  - **If \\( K > m \\):**  \n",
    "    The kth symbol in row \\( N \\) is the complement of the \\((K - m)\\)th symbol in row \\( N-1 \\).  \n",
    "    Formally,  \n",
    "    \\[\n",
    "    kthSymbolGrammar(N, K) = \\text{complement}(kthSymbolGrammar(N-1, K-m))\n",
    "    \\]\n",
    "  \n",
    "Since by the inductive hypothesis the kth symbol for row \\( N-1 \\) is determined correctly, applying the above rules correctly computes the kth symbol for row \\( N \\).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "This completes the inductive reasoning:\n",
    "- **Base Case:** The result is known for N = 1.\n",
    "- **Inductive Hypothesis:** We assume correctness for row N–1.\n",
    "- **Inductive Step:** Using the properties of the grammar, we correctly map the kth symbol in row N to row N–1.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, by mathematical induction, our recursive strategy works for all rows.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Detailed Explanation with Code\n",
    "\n",
    "Below is a concise C++ implementation that follows the above strategy:\n",
    "\n",
    "```cpp\n",
    "#include <iostream>\n",
    "using namespace std;\n",
    "\n",
    "int kthSymbolGrammar(int N, int K) {\n",
    "    // Base Case: In row 1, the only symbol is 0.\n",
    "    if (N == 1 && K == 1)\n",
    "        return 0;\n",
    "    \n",
    "    // Calculate the midpoint of the current row.\n",
    "    int mid = 1 << (N - 2);  // This is 2^(N-2)\n",
    "    \n",
    "    // If K is in the first half, the symbol is the same as in row (N-1).\n",
    "    if (K <= mid)\n",
    "        return kthSymbolGrammar(N - 1, K);\n",
    "    else {\n",
    "        // Otherwise, K is in the second half. The symbol is the complement of the corresponding symbol in row (N-1).\n",
    "        int val = kthSymbolGrammar(N - 1, K - mid);\n",
    "        return val == 0 ? 1 : 0;\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "int main() {\n",
    "    int N = 4, K = 5;\n",
    "    cout << kthSymbolGrammar(N, K) << endl;  // Expected output: 1\n",
    "    return 0;\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Complexity Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Time Complexity:**  \n",
    "  The recursion reduces N by 1 in each step, leading to a complexity of \\( O(N) \\). Since the value of K is at most \\(2^{N-1}\\), you could also view this as \\( O(\\log K) \\).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Space Complexity:**  \n",
    "  The recursion uses \\( O(N) \\) space on the call stack.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5. Animated Visualization (Optional)\n",
    "\n",
    "For further clarity, you might create an interactive visualization using Python libraries like `ipywidgets` and `matplotlib`. Such a visualization can display each recursive call, showing how the input is divided and how the complement is applied when needed. (Refer to earlier examples if you wish to build this interactive tool.)\n",

    "---\n",
