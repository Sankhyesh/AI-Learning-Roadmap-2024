    "# Recursive Insertion Sort (“sort” Function)\n",
    "\n",
    "This handout demonstrates a **recursive insertion sort** technique implemented with a function called `sort`. The algorithm removes (or “folds out”) the last element of an array, recursively sorts the smaller sub-array, and then reinserts the removed element into its correct position. Below is a structured 4‐step flow covering the **IP–OP–PS**, **Identification**, **Break Down**, **Explanations + Code**, and an **Animated Visualization** section.\n",

    "## 1. IP–OP–PS (Input, Output, Problem Statement)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "**Goal:** Sort an array (or vector) of integers using a recursive approach that:\n",
    "1. Removes the last element (folds it out).\n",
    "2. Recursively sorts the remaining elements.\n",
    "3. Re-inserts the removed element into its correct position in the sorted sub-array.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Expected Input\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Input:** A vector/array `v` of integers (e.g., `[3, 1, 4, 2]`).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Expected Output\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Output:** The same vector/array, but in sorted (ascending) order (e.g., `[1, 2, 3, 4]`).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Detailed Example\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Sample Input:** `[5, 2, 9, 1]`\n",
    "- **Process:**  \n",
    "  1. Remove the last element (`1`), recursively sort `[5, 2, 9]`.  \n",
    "  2. Recursively sort `[5, 2, 9]` by folding out `9`, sorting `[5, 2]`, then inserting `9`.  \n",
    "  3. Finally, insert the removed element `1` into the correct position of the sorted `[2, 5, 9]`.  \n",
    "- **Sample Output:** `[1, 2, 5, 9]`\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Identification\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Is This a Candidate for a **Recursive** Approach?\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Self-Similarity (Divide & Conquer / Insert):**  \n",
    "   Each time we remove one element, we reduce the problem to sorting a smaller sub-array. Once the smaller sub-array is sorted, we “insert” the removed element into its proper position.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Simple Base Condition:**  \n",
    "   When the array has 0 or 1 elements, it is trivially sorted.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Key Cues:**\n",
    "   - Removing a single element and then re-inserting it is characteristic of **insertion sort** logic.\n",
    "   - Recursively sorting the remainder leverages the idea that the sub-array can be handled with the same procedure.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Break Down → Recursive Insertion Sort\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step-by-Step Sub-Tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Base Case:**  \n",
    "   - If the array `v` has size ≤ 1, return immediately because a single element (or none) is already sorted.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Remove (“Fold Out”) the Last Element:**\n",
    "   - Extract the last element: `int temp = v.back();`\n",
    "   - Remove it from the array: `v.pop_back();`\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Recursive Call on the Smaller Array:**\n",
    "   - Call `sort(v);` on the array without its last element.\n",
    "   - This step eventually reaches the base case.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Re-Insert (“Unfold”) the Removed Element:**\n",
    "   - Once the smaller array is sorted, insert `temp` into the correct position.  \n",
    "   - This is usually done with a helper function, e.g. `insertInSortedOrder(v, temp);`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Initialization & Data Structures\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Initialization:**  \n",
    "  - Simply call `sort(v);` on the entire vector. No extra data structures are required aside from a small helper function for insertion.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Data Structures:**  \n",
    "  - **Vector/Array `v`:** The main data structure to be sorted.  \n",
    "  - **Temporary Storage:** An integer `temp` holds the last element during the recursion.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Iterative Update:**  \n",
    "  - Each recursive call sorts one fewer element. Once the sub-array is sorted, we insert the removed element. This step is repeated until the entire array is sorted.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Explanations + Code\n",
    "\n",
    "### Detailed Explanation\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Base Condition Check:**\n",
    "   - If `v.size() <= 1`, do nothing. The array is already sorted.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Fold Out the Last Element:**\n",
    "   - `int temp = v.back();`\n",
    "   - `v.pop_back();`\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Recursively Sort the Remaining Array:**\n",
    "   - `sort(v);`\n",
    "   - This will continue until `v.size() <= 1`.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Re-Insert the Folded Element:**\n",
    "   - Use a helper function, typically named `insertInSortedOrder(v, temp)`, to place `temp` at the correct position in the now-sorted sub-array.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Time Complexity:**\n",
    "   - In the worst case, this approach has a complexity akin to insertion sort: **O(n²)**.  \n",
    "   - For each of the `n` elements, we may need to shift elements to find the correct position, leading to O(n²) in the worst case.\n",

    "- **merge_sort_visual:**  \n",
    "  Recursively sorts the array and records significant steps (dividing and merging) along with the current state.\n",
    "- **merge_visual:**  \n",
    "  Merges two sorted subarrays and logs the state after each operation.\n",
    "- **Interactive Widget:**  \n",
    "  An `IntSlider` lets you step through the process and view both the current array state and a description of the action.\n",
    "- **Visualization:**  \n",
    "  A bar chart displays the current state of the array at each step.\n",
