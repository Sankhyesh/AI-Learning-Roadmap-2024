    "\n",
    "This handout explains how to compute the height of a binary tree using recursion. We will discuss the problem statement, why recursion fits naturally with this problem, and then break down the solution into its base condition and recursive (inductive) step. A sample code implementation is provided to illustrate the concept.\n",

    "## 1. Problem Statement (IP – OP)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Input (IP)\n",
    "- A binary tree where each node contains:\n",
    "  - A value (optional for this problem)\n",
    "  - Pointers (or references) to its left and right children (which may be `null`/`None`)\n",

    "- **Recursive Insight:**  \n",
    "  - **Hypothesis:** Assume the recursive function correctly computes the height for any subtree.\n",
    "  - **Inductive Step:** Then the height of the current tree is the maximum height of the left or right subtree, plus one (to account for the current node).\n",
    "\n",

    "## 1. IP–OP–PS (Input, Output, Problem Statement)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem Statement\n",
    "Given a binary tree, determine its height (or maximum depth). The **height** of a binary tree is defined as the number of nodes along the longest path from the root node down to the farthest leaf node. For an empty tree, the height is 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Expected Inputs\n",
    "- **Root node** of a binary tree (or `nullptr`/`None` if the tree is empty).\n",
    "- Each node in the tree typically has:\n",
    "  - A value\n",
    "  - A pointer/reference to its left child\n",
    "  - A pointer/reference to its right child\n",
    "\n",
    "### Expected Outputs\n",
    "- **An integer** representing the height of the tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Detailed Example\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the following binary tree:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "        10\n",
    "       /  \\\n",
    "      5    15\n",

    "- The longest path could be `10 → 5 → 2` or `10 → 5 → 7` or `10 → 15 → 18`.\n",
    "- Each path has **3** nodes, so the height is **3**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hence, for this input tree, the output should be **3**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Identification\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why is this problem a candidate for a **recursive** solution?\n",
    "1. **Self-Similarity (Divide-and-Conquer):**  \n",
    "   A binary tree is naturally recursive: each node is the root of its own subtree. To find the height of the whole tree, we need the height of its left subtree and its right subtree.\n",
    "2. **Top-Down or Bottom-Up Approach:**  \n",
    "   We can define the height of the current node in terms of the heights of its children (plus one).\n",
    "3. **Key Cue:**  \n",
    "   - Whenever a tree-based problem asks for a property (like height, size, or sum) that can be expressed via subtrees, recursion is often the most straightforward solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Break Down → Recursion\n",
    "\n",
    "Below is a step-by-step breakdown of the recursive solution to compute the height of a binary tree:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Base Case:**  \n",
    "   - If the current node is `nullptr` (or `None`), the height is **0** because an empty tree has height 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Recursive Case:**  \n",
    "   - Recursively compute the height of the **left** subtree.\n",
    "   - Recursively compute the height of the **right** subtree.\n",
    "   - The height of the current node is `1 + max(left_subtree_height, right_subtree_height)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Initialization:**  \n",
    "   - Start with the **root** node of the tree. If `root` is `nullptr`, the answer is immediately **0**.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Data Structure Used:**  \n",
    "   - **Implicit Call Stack**: The recursion stack is used to traverse down to the leaves and unwind back up to the root.\n",
    "   - **Tree Node Structure**: Each node has `val`, `left`, and `right`.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Iterative Update:**  \n",
    "   - At each node, the recursion returns the height of the subtree.\n",
    "   - The result is combined to produce the height at the parent node, step by step.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Explanations + Code\n",
    "\n",
    "### Detailed Explanation of Each Step\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Check for Null**  \n",
    "   - If the node is `nullptr`, return `0`.\n",
    "2. **Recur on Left**  \n",
    "   - Let `left_height = height(root->left)`.\n",
    "3. **Recur on Right**  \n",
    "   - Let `right_height = height(root->right)`.\n",
    "4. **Combine Results**  \n",
    "   - The height at `root` is `1 + max(left_height, right_height)`.\n",
    "5. **Time Complexity**  \n",
    "   - **O(n)**, where `n` is the number of nodes in the tree. In the worst case (a skewed tree), we visit each node once.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. **build_example_tree:**  \n",
    "   Creates a sample binary tree for demonstration.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **compute_height:**  \n",
    "   - A helper function `height_helper` traverses the tree recursively.  \n",
    "   - At each call, it records a descriptive message about the current node, depth, and returned height.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **visualize_height_calculation (step):**  \n",
    "   - Uses `matplotlib` and `networkx` to draw the tree.  \n",
    "   - Displays the message from the `steps` list corresponding to the chosen `step` in the recursion.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Interactive Widget:**  \n",
    "   - The `IntSlider` from `ipywidgets` allows you to move through each step of the recursion trace, illustrating how the height is computed.\n",

    "# End of Handout\n",
    "\n",
    "This handout provides:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **IP–OP–PS:** A clear definition of the problem (Height of a Binary Tree), including inputs and outputs.  \n",
    "2. **Identification:** Reasons why a recursive DFS approach is suitable.  \n",
    "3. **Break Down:** Step-by-step sub-tasks (base case, recursive case, data structure).  \n",
    "4. **Explanations + Code:** A concise C++ implementation (with time complexity) and a Python alternative.  \n",
    "5. **Animated Visualization:** An interactive Python snippet that reveals the internal recursion process step by step.\n",
