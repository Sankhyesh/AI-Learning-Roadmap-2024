    "# Sort a Stack Using Recursion\n",
    "\n",
    "This handout explains how to sort a stack using a recursive approach. The algorithm works by removing the top element from the stack, recursively sorting the remaining stack, and then inserting the removed element back into its correct position. This is done without using any extra data structures (apart from recursion’s call stack).\n",

    "## 1. IP–OP–PS (Input, Output, Problem Statement)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem Statement\n",
    "Given a stack of integers, sort the stack in ascending order using only recursion. You may only use a few temporary variables but no additional data structures (such as another stack or an array).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Expected Input\n",
    "- **Input:** A stack (LIFO) of integers.\n",
    "  - *Example:* A stack with elements (top to bottom): `[34, 3, 31, 98, 92, 23]`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Expected Output\n",
    "- **Output:** The same stack, but sorted such that the smallest element is at the top.\n",
    "  - *Example:* After sorting, the stack (top to bottom) becomes: `[3, 23, 31, 34, 92, 98]`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Detailed Example\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Sample Input:**  \n",
    "  Stack: Top → `[34, 3, 31, 98, 92, 23]` ← Bottom\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Sample Output:**  \n",
    "  Sorted Stack: Top → `[3, 23, 31, 34, 92, 98]` ← Bottom\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Identification\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why is This Problem a Candidate for Recursion?\n",
    "- **Self-Similarity:**  \n",
    "  Sorting a stack can be reduced to a smaller instance of the same problem. If you remove one element, you need to sort the rest of the stack and then insert the removed element in its correct position.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Divide and Conquer:**  \n",
    "  The problem naturally divides into two steps:\n",
    "  1. Recursively sorting a smaller stack (after popping the top element).\n",
    "  2. Inserting the popped element into the sorted stack.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Minimal Extra Data Structures:**  \n",
    "  Recursion provides an elegant solution that uses the call stack to hold temporary data instead of using an extra stack or array.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Key Cues from the Transcript:**  \n",
    "  - The speaker uses phrases like \"folding\" and \"preserving the foundation\" to indicate removing an element and then later \"unfolding\" (or re-inserting) it.\n",
    "  - Emphasis on handling “small inputs” and verifying conditions before re-insertion.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Break Down → Recursive Stack Sort\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step-by-Step Sub-Tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Base Condition:**  \n",
    "   - If the stack is empty, or has only one element, it is already sorted. Return.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Remove the Top Element:**  \n",
    "   - Pop the top element from the stack. This is similar to “folding out” an element to reduce the problem size.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Recursive Call:**  \n",
    "   - Recursively call the sort function to sort the remaining stack (which is now smaller).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Insert the Removed Element:**  \n",
    "   - Once the smaller stack is sorted, insert the removed element back into the sorted stack in the correct position.\n",
    "   - Use a helper function (e.g., `insertInSortedOrder`) to compare and place the element appropriately.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Initialization & Data Structures\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Initialization:**  \n",
    "  - Start with the given stack.\n",
    "  - The recursive function is initially called on the full stack.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Data Structures:**  \n",
    "  - **Stack:** The main data structure that holds the elements.\n",
    "  - **Temporary Variable:** A variable to store the popped element during recursion.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Iterative Update:**  \n",
    "  - At each recursive call, the stack size decreases by one.\n",
    "  - Upon re-insertion, the element is placed correctly, gradually building up a fully sorted stack.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Explanations + Code\n",
    "\n",
    "### Detailed Explanation of Each Step\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Base Condition:**  \n",
    "   - Check if the stack is empty (or has one element). If yes, no further action is needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Remove the Top Element:**  \n",
    "   - Pop the element from the top and store it in a temporary variable (`temp`).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Recursive Sorting:**  \n",
    "   - Recursively call the sorting function on the smaller stack (without `temp`).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Insert the Element:**  \n",
    "   - After the recursive call returns (i.e., the smaller stack is sorted), call a helper function to insert `temp` back into the stack at its correct position.\n",
    "   - The helper function works by comparing `temp` with the current top element of the stack and inserting it appropriately.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Time Complexity:**  \n",
    "   - In the worst-case, the time complexity is O(n²) because for each element, in the worst case, you might need to shift all the sorted elements during insertion.\n",
