    "# **Find the Longest Subarray With Sum = K**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **1. Problem Statement (IP–OP–PS)**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Input:**\n",
    "  1. An integer array (e.g., \\([4, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5]\\)).\n",
    "  2. A target sum \\(K\\) (e.g., 5).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Output:**\n",
    "  - The **length** of the **longest subarray** whose elements sum to exactly \\(K\\).\n",
    "  - If no subarray sums to \\(K\\), you might return 0 (or \\(-1\\), depending on the problem statement).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Example:**\n",
    "  - Array: \\([4, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5]\\), \\(K = 5\\)\n",
    "  - Subarrays that sum to 5 include:\n",
    "    - \\([4, 1]\\) (length 2)\n",
    "    - \\([5]\\) (length 1)\n",
    "    - \\([1, 1, 1, 2]\\) → sums to 5 (length 4)\n",
    "    - \\([2, 3]\\) (length 2)\n",
    "  - The **longest** among these has length **4** (the subarray \\([1, 1, 1, 2]\\)).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **2. Identification**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Variable-Size Sliding Window**  \n",
    "  Since we’re searching for subarrays with a specific sum \\(K\\), the window size is **not** fixed. We’ll expand (`j++`) to increase the sum and contract (`i++`) when the sum exceeds \\(K\\).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Key Observations**  \n",
    "  - We only handle **positive** integers in the example. This ensures that once our sum exceeds \\(K\\), removing elements from the left (incrementing `i`) will reduce the sum.\n",
    "  - If **negative** integers were allowed, the logic for contracting/expanding the window would need additional care (see *Negative Number Consideration* below).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **3. Break Down → Variable-Size Window Steps**\n",
    "\n",
    "Below is a typical flow for **finding subarrays that sum exactly to \\(K\\)** using a variable-size window:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initialize:**\n",
    "   - Set two pointers `i = 0`, `j = 0`.\n",
    "   - Maintain a running sum: `current_sum = 0`.\n",
    "   - Maintain a variable `max_length = 0` (or \\(-1\\)) to track the longest subarray found so far.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Expand (`j++`) Until sum >= K:**\n",
    "   - At each step, add `arr[j]` to `current_sum`.\n",
    "   - If `current_sum < K`, you still need more elements, so keep moving `j` forward.\n",
    "   - If `current_sum == K`, record the subarray length `(j - i + 1)` and update `max_length` if needed. Then typically move `j` forward to find more subarrays.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Contract (`i++`) If sum > K:**\n",
    "   - While `current_sum > K`, remove elements from the left:\n",
    "     - Subtract `arr[i]` from `current_sum`.\n",
    "     - Increment `i`.\n",
    "   - Once `current_sum` is <= K again, check if it’s exactly \\(K\\). If yes, update `max_length`.\n",
    "   - Continue with `j++`.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Result:**\n",
    "   - After iterating until `j` reaches the end of the array, `max_length` holds the size of the longest subarray summing to \\(K\\).  \n",
    "   - If no subarray was found, `max_length` might remain 0 (or \\(-1\\), depending on how you initialize it).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **4. Explanation & Example**\n",
    "\n",
    "Below is a **pseudocode** style snippet (in C++-like syntax). We assume **all elements are nonnegative**:\n",
    "\n",
    "```cpp\n",
    "int longestSubarraySumK(vector<int>& arr, int K) {\n",
    "    int n = arr.size();\n",
    "    int i = 0, j = 0;\n",
    "    long long current_sum = 0;   // track the running sum\n",
    "    int max_length = 0;          // track longest subarray length\n",
    "\n",
    "    while (j < n) {\n",
    "        // 1) Expand: add arr[j] to current_sum\n",
    "        current_sum += arr[j];\n",
    "\n",
    "        // 2) If current_sum == K, update max_length\n",
    "        if (current_sum == K) {\n",
    "            max_length = max(max_length, j - i + 1);\n",
    "        }\n",
    "\n",
    "        // 3) If current_sum > K, contract from the left\n",
    "        while (current_sum > K && i <= j) {\n",
    "            current_sum -= arr[i];\n",
    "            i++;\n",
    "\n",
    "            // After removing, if current_sum == K, update max_length\n",
    "            if (current_sum == K) {\n",
    "                max_length = max(max_length, j - i + 1);\n",
    "            }\n",
    "        }\n",
    "\n",
    "        // 4) Move j forward to check for more subarrays\n",
    "        j++;\n",
    "    }\n",
    "\n",
    "    return max_length;\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Explanation of Key Parts:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **current_sum += arr[j]**  \n",
    "   Expands the window by including the new element at `j`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Check `current_sum == K`**  \n",
    "   If the sum is exactly \\(K\\), record the length `(j - i + 1)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **While `current_sum > K`**  \n",
    "   - Remove elements from the left (`arr[i]`), increment `i`.\n",
    "   - After each removal, check again if the sum is exactly \\(K\\).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Increment `j`**  \n",
    "   Continue expanding to find new subarrays.\n",

    "### **Negative Number Consideration**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Why Nonnegative Elements Matter**  \n",
    "  If the array can contain **negative** numbers, simply removing elements from the left might not always reduce the sum in a straightforward way (because negative numbers can **increase** the sum if you remove them, or it might be possible to exceed \\(K\\) but then come back down to \\(K\\) by adding more elements, etc.).  \n",
    "  This complicates the logic significantly.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **If Negative Numbers Are Allowed**  \n",
    "  - A typical variable-size window approach (expanding when sum < \\(K\\), contracting when sum > \\(K\\)) **does not** always work reliably.  \n",
    "  - Often, you must use **prefix sums** + **hash maps** or other data structures (e.g., to handle subarray sum = \\(K\\) problems with negatives).  \n",
    "  - For instance, *\"Longest Subarray with Sum = K (including negatives)\"* is often solved via a prefix-sum + dictionary approach, not by a naive sliding window.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Summary of Key Points**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Problem Statement**: We want the length of the **longest** subarray whose sum = \\(K\\).  \n",
    "2. **Variable-Size Window**: Because the window size is not fixed, we expand (`j++`) until sum >= \\(K\\), and if sum > \\(K\\), we contract from the left (`i++`).  \n",
    "3. **Record Length**: Whenever `current_sum == K`, we update `max_length`.  \n",
    "4. **Negative Numbers**: The above approach works smoothly if elements are **nonnegative**. If negatives are present, a more general prefix-sum method is typically required.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**Takeaways**  \n",
    "- A **variable-size sliding window** is straightforward for *nonnegative* arrays.  \n",
    "- You expand the window to reach \\(K\\) and shrink it if you exceed \\(K\\).  \n",
    "- Each time you hit \\(K\\), record the subarray length. Keep track of the **longest** such subarray.  \n",
    "- For arrays with **negative** numbers, consider using **prefix sums + hashing** instead of a pure sliding window.\n",
