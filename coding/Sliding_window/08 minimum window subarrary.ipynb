    "# **Minimum Window Subarray**\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Problem Context:**  \n",
    "> In many “minimum window” problems (such as the classical Minimum Window Substring), you are given an input (a string or array) and a target condition (e.g. a target sum, or containing all required characters). Your task is to find the smallest (minimum-length) contiguous segment (window) of the input that satisfies this condition.  \n",
    ">  \n",
    "> In our example, we assume that the condition has already been defined (for instance, “the window’s sum is at least a target value” or “the window contains all required characters”). The handout below is generic and can be adapted for various minimum window problems.\n",

    "### **Problem Statement**\n",
    "\n",
    "Given an array (or string) and a target condition, find the **minimum-length subarray (window)** that satisfies that condition.  \n",
    "If no subarray satisfies the condition, return an appropriate value (for example, 0).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Example (Assuming a Sum Condition):**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Input:**  \n",
    "  - `nums = [4, 2, 2, 7, 8, 1, 2, 8, 10]`  \n",
    "  - Target: Sum ≥ 14\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Output:**  \n",
    "  - The smallest subarray that has a sum ≥ 14 is `[7, 8]` with length 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Note:* For string-based versions (e.g., “Minimum Window Substring”), the condition might be that the window contains all required characters.\n",

    "### **Expected Inputs/Outputs**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Input:**  \n",
    "  - An array (or string) `arr` of size `n`.  \n",
    "  - A target condition (e.g., window sum ≥ `S` or contains all required characters).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Output:**  \n",
    "  - An integer representing the length of the minimum window that meets the condition (or the window itself).\n",

    "- **Contiguity:**  \n",
    "  The problem requires examining contiguous subarrays of `arr`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Variable Window Size:**  \n",
    "  Unlike fixed-size problems, here the window size is not predetermined. Instead, you dynamically expand the window until the condition is met, then contract it to find the minimal window.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Efficiency:**  \n",
    "  A sliding window approach enables you to update the window’s state (e.g., current sum, frequency counts) incrementally rather than recomputing from scratch for each candidate window.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Key Cues:*  \n",
    "- Look for phrases like “minimum window” or “smallest subarray” and conditions (e.g., “sum ≥ target” or “contains all characters”).\n",

    "## 3. Break Down → Sliding Window Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "### **General Steps (Using a Variable-Size Window)**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initialize:**  \n",
    "   - Set two pointers: `i = 0` (start) and `j = 0` (end).\n",
    "   - Initialize a variable (e.g., `current_sum`) or data structure (e.g., a frequency map) to track the state of the window.\n",
    "   - Set a variable `min_len` (or store the window boundaries) to track the smallest valid window found.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Expand the Window:**  \n",
    "   - Increase `j` (i.e., add `arr[j]` to the current state) until the condition is met.  \n",
    "   - For example, if the condition is “sum ≥ S,” keep adding until `current_sum ≥ S`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Contract the Window:**  \n",
    "   - Once the condition is met, try to **contract** from the left (increment `i`) to remove unnecessary elements while still satisfying the condition.\n",
    "   - Update `min_len` (or record the window boundaries) if the current window is smaller than the previously recorded one.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Slide and Continue:**  \n",
    "   - Continue the process until `j` has reached the end of the array.\n",
    "   - Finally, return the minimum window’s length (or the window itself).\n",

    "### **Explanation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initialization:**  \n",
    "   - Pointers `i` and `j` are set to 0.\n",
    "   - `current_sum` is initialized to 0; `min_len` is set to a high value.\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. **Window Expansion:**  \n",
    "   - The loop adds `arr[j]` to `current_sum` as `j` moves from 0 to `n-1`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Condition Checking & Contraction:**  \n",
    "   - When `current_sum` is **greater than or equal** to `target`, the current window satisfies the condition.\n",
    "   - Inside the inner while loop, update `min_len` if the current window size is smaller.\n",
    "   - Then, contract the window from the left by subtracting `arr[i]` and incrementing `i`.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Result:**  \n",
    "   - Finally, if no window meets the condition, return 0; otherwise, return the recorded `min_len`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Time Complexity:**  \n",
    "- Each element is processed at most twice (once when expanding and once when contracting), so the overall time complexity is \\(O(n)\\).\n",
