    "Below is a **generic sliding window template** that you can adapt for various fixed‐size sliding window problems (such as finding sums, counts, maxima, minima, etc.). This template follows the typical pattern of maintaining two pointers \\(`i` and `j`\\) to represent the current window boundaries, performing incremental **calculations** as you move the window, and extracting an **answer** whenever the window size reaches \\(k\\).\n",

    "## **Explanation of Each Section**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initialization**  \n",
    "   - `i = 0` and `j = 0` mark the start and end of the sliding window.  \n",
    "   - You may also define any additional variables needed for your particular problem (e.g., `window_sum`, frequency maps, or data structures).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **While Loop**  \n",
    "   - The condition `while (j < n)` ensures you move the window’s end `j` across the entire array.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Calculations (Inside the Loop)**  \n",
    "   - Whenever you include `arr[j]` in the window, update your data structures or variables accordingly. Examples:\n",
    "     - `window_sum += arr[j]`\n",
    "     - Increment a frequency map: `freq[arr[j]]++`\n",
    "     - Maintain a deque for maximum/minimum, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Check Window Size**  \n",
    "   - If `(j - i + 1) < k`, the window is not yet full; just expand by doing `j++`.\n",
    "   - If `(j - i + 1) == k`, you have a full window of size `k`.  \n",
    "     - **Extract or record your answer** from this window (e.g., push the current sum or max into `result`).  \n",
    "     - **Remove** the effect of the outgoing element `arr[i]` (e.g., `window_sum -= arr[i]`, or `freq[arr[i]]--`, or pop from a deque if needed).  \n",
    "     - **Slide** the window by incrementing both `i` and `j`.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Result**  \n",
    "   - After the loop finishes, your `result` vector (or whichever structure you’re using) contains all the computed answers (e.g., sums, maxima, etc.) for each valid window.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Usage Examples**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Maximum/Minimum of Subarray of Size \\(k\\)**  \n",
    "   - **Calculations**: Use a deque to track potential maxima/minima.  \n",
    "   - **Removal**: Pop front if it’s out of the window, pop smaller (for max) or larger (for min) elements from the back.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Sum of Subarray of Size \\(k\\)**  \n",
    "   - **Calculations**: Add `arr[j]` to `window_sum`.  \n",
    "   - **Removal**: Subtract `arr[i]` from `window_sum` when sliding the window.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Count of Something in a Subarray**  \n",
    "   - **Calculations**: Maintain a frequency map (or count).  \n",
    "   - **Removal**: Decrement frequency of `arr[i]` before sliding.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Variable-Size Window**  \n",
    "   - Slightly different logic in the `while (j < n)` loop, typically adjusting `i` based on conditions (e.g., sum exceeding a threshold, or unique character constraints).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Key Points**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Window Size**: \\( j - i + 1 \\)  \n",
    "- **Increment `j`** to expand the window.  \n",
    "- **Increment `i`** to shrink or slide the window.  \n",
    "- **Record Answer** when the window size is **exactly** \\( k \\).  \n",
    "- **Remove Outgoing Element** from any running calculations before incrementing `i`.\n",
    "\n",
    "This template should give you a **generic skeleton** for handling most fixed‐size sliding window problems. You only need to customize:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Calculations** (how you update or store values each time you include `arr[j]`),  \n",
    "- **Answer** (how you compute or record the result for each window),  \n",
    "- **Removal** (how you undo the effect of `arr[i]` when the window slides).\n",
    "\n",
    "With these steps, you can confidently tackle a wide range of sliding window problems."
