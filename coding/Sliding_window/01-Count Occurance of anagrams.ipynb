    "### **Problem Statement**  \n",
    "Given a string **S** and a pattern **P**, count the number of occurrences of any anagram of **P** within **S**. An occurrence is valid if the substring of **S** (of length equal to **P**) is an anagram of **P**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Input**  \n",
    "- **S (String):** For example, `\"BACDGABCDA\"`  \n",
    "- **P (Pattern):** For example, `\"ABCD\"`\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Output**  \n",
    "An integer count (or list of starting indices) indicating how many times an anagram of **P** appears in **S**.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Example**  \n",
    "- **S:** `\"BACDGABCDA\"`  \n",
    "- **P:** `\"ABCD\"`  \n",
    "- **Output:**  \n",
    "  - The anagrams of `\"ABCD\"` found in `\"BACDGABCDA\"` are `\"BACD\"`, `\"ACDG\"` (if it matches the frequency), etc.  \n",
    "  - In this example, assume the valid windows are at indices 0, 5, and 6 (for instance).  \n",
    "  - Final count: **3**\n",

    "\n",
    "## 2. **Identification**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Contiguous Substrings:**  \n",
    "  The problem asks you to examine every substring of **S** with length equal to the pattern **P**.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Frequency Matching:**  \n",
    "  Instead of re-computing frequency counts for each substring from scratch (brute force), you can use a **sliding window** to update a frequency map incrementally.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Efficient Update:**  \n",
    "  With a sliding window, when the window moves one step, update the count for the outgoing and incoming characters, then compare the frequency map to that of **P**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because of these cues, this problem is an ideal candidate for the **sliding window technique** combined with frequency count comparison.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. **Break Down → Sliding Window**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initialize:**\n",
    "   - Build a frequency map (or count) for the pattern **P**.\n",
    "   - Process the first window (first \\(k\\) characters of **S**, where \\(k = \\text{len}(P)\\)) and build its frequency map.\n",
    "  \n",
    "2. **Slide the Window:**\n",
    "   - For each new window (by moving one step to the right):\n",
    "     - Decrement the frequency count of the outgoing character.\n",
    "     - Increment the frequency count of the new character.\n",
    "     - Compare the updated frequency map with that of **P**.\n",
    "  \n",
    "3. **Record the Result:**\n",
    "   - If the current window’s frequency map matches **P**’s frequency map, increment your count.\n",
    "   - Continue until the end of **S**.\n",
