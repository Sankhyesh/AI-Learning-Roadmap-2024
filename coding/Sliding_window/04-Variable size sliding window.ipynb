    "# **Variable-Size Sliding Window: Notes**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **1. Problem Statement (IP–OP–PS)**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Input:**  \n",
    "  1. An array (or string) of numbers/elements.  \n",
    "  2. A target condition (e.g., sum ≥ a certain value, sum = a certain value, no more than X distinct elements, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Output:**  \n",
    "  Often one of the following:  \n",
    "  - The **largest** or **smallest** window that satisfies the condition.  \n",
    "  - The **number of** windows (or subarrays) that satisfy the condition.  \n",
    "  - The **maximum** (or minimum) sum/length under some constraint.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Problem Statement Example:**  \n",
    "  *“Given an array of nonnegative integers and a target sum \\(S\\), find the **minimum** subarray length such that the subarray’s sum is at least \\(S\\). If no such subarray exists, return 0.”*  \n",
    "  Or, *“Given an array and a target sum \\(S\\), find the **largest** subarray whose sum does not exceed \\(S\\).”*\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **2. Identification**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Dynamic Window Size:**  \n",
    "   - In a **fixed-size** sliding window, the window length \\(k\\) is constant.  \n",
    "   - In a **variable-size** sliding window, the window length **changes** based on some condition (e.g., sum of elements in the window, the number of distinct characters, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Condition-Driven Expansion & Contraction:**  \n",
    "   - We usually expand the end pointer `j` to include more elements until the condition is met or exceeded.\n",
    "   - Then we **shrink** the window from the start pointer `i` if the condition is violated or to find a minimal (or other) requirement.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Overlapping Subarrays:**  \n",
    "   - Like fixed-size windows, we still have overlapping segments, but the start pointer `i` doesn’t simply increment in lockstep with `j`; it moves **only** when the condition demands it.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **3. Break Down → Variable-Size Sliding Window**\n",
    "\n",
    "Below is a generic step-by-step outline:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initialize Pointers:**  \n",
    "   - Set `i = 0` and `j = 0`.  \n",
    "   - Optionally, keep a `current_sum = 0` (or other data structure) to track the condition.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Expand the Window:**  \n",
    "   - Increase `j` (end pointer) to include more elements, updating `current_sum` or other data.  \n",
    "   - Continue until you either **meet** the target condition (e.g., `current_sum >= S`) or you reach the end of the array.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Check Condition & Contract:**  \n",
    "   - Once the condition is met or exceeded, you often want to **shrink** the window from the left (`i++`) to find the smallest window that still satisfies the condition (or to continue searching for the next valid window).  \n",
    "   - Update `current_sum` (or your data structure) as you remove `arr[i]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Record Answers:**  \n",
    "   - Depending on the problem, each time you find a window that satisfies the condition, you might:\n",
    "     - Update a global **minimum** or **maximum** length.\n",
    "     - Count the number of valid windows.\n",
    "     - Track the subarray boundaries.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Continue Until `j` Reaches the End:**  \n",
    "   - Move `j` until the end of the array, expanding and contracting the window as dictated by the condition.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **4. Explanations & Example Logic**\n",
    "\n",
    "Below is a **generic** pseudocode snippet for a common variable-size window scenario:  \n",
    "> *\"Find the minimum subarray length such that the subarray sum ≥ `S`.\"*\n",
    "\n",
    "```cpp\n",
    "int minSubArrayLen(vector<int>& arr, int S) {\n",
    "    int n = arr.size();\n",
    "    int i = 0, j = 0;        // Start and end of window\n",
    "    long long current_sum = 0;\n",
    "    int min_len = INT_MAX;   // Or some large sentinel value\n",
    "\n",
    "    while (j < n) {\n",
    "        // 1) Expand the window by including arr[j]\n",
    "        current_sum += arr[j];\n",
    "\n",
    "        // 2) Check if condition is met: current_sum >= S\n",
    "        while (current_sum >= S) {\n",
    "            // Record the current window's length\n",
    "            int window_len = j - i + 1;\n",
    "            min_len = min(min_len, window_len);\n",
    "\n",
    "            // 3) Contract from the left: remove arr[i]\n",
    "            current_sum -= arr[i];\n",
    "            i++;\n",
    "        }\n",
    "        \n",
    "        // 4) Move 'j' to expand the window further\n",
    "        j++;\n",
    "    }\n",
    "\n",
    "    return (min_len == INT_MAX) ? 0 : min_len;\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Explanation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initialize:**  \n",
    "   - `i = 0, j = 0, current_sum = 0`.\n",
    "   - `min_len` tracks the best (smallest) valid window found so far.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Expand (`j++`):**  \n",
    "   - Add `arr[j]` to `current_sum`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Check Condition:**  \n",
    "   - While the sum is **≥ S**, we have a valid window.  \n",
    "   - Update `min_len` with the current window’s size (`j - i + 1`).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Contract (`i++`):**  \n",
    "   - Subtract `arr[i]` from `current_sum` to try and make the window smaller while still meeting the condition.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Repeat:**  \n",
    "   - Continue until `j` reaches the end of the array.  \n",
    "   - If no window ever meets the condition, `min_len` remains `INT_MAX`, so we return 0.\n",

    "### **Final Recap**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Problem Statement:**  \n",
    "   - In variable-size sliding window problems, you’re given a condition (e.g., sum ≥ X) rather than a fixed window size.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Identification:**  \n",
    "   - You’ll see references to subarrays/strings and a target condition (not a fixed \\(k\\)).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Break Down:**  \n",
    "   - **Expand** `j` until the condition is met (or violated).  \n",
    "   - **Contract** from `i` if the window can be shrunk while still meeting the condition (or to re-satisfy it).  \n",
    "   - **Record** the relevant result (minimum/maximum length, count, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Explanations & Example:**  \n",
    "   - The sample pseudocode (min subarray length ≥ S) demonstrates how to maintain `current_sum`, expand with `j`, and contract with `i` when the condition is fulfilled.\n",
