    "### Problem Statement\n",
    "Given an array of positive integers and a desired difference `D`, partition the array into two subsets such that the absolute difference between their sums is `D`. Instead of simply finding a partition, our goal is to count the number of ways this can be done.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Input\n",
    "- **Array:** A list of positive integers (e.g., `[2, 3, 7, 8, 10]`).\n",
    "- **Difference, D:** The target difference between the subset sums.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Output\n",
    "- **Count of Ways:** An integer representing the number of ways to partition the array into two subsets where the difference of their sums equals `D`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Detailed Example\n",
    "Suppose we are given an array and a difference such that when the total sum is combined with the difference, the target subset sum is computed as:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[\n",
    "T = \\frac{\\text{Total Sum} + D}{2} = 12.\n",
    "\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "The task is then to count the number of subsets within the array whose sum is exactly **12**.\n",

    "   Sum all the array elements to get \\(S\\).  \n",

    "2. **Transform the Problem:**  \n",
    "   Now, the problem reduces to counting the subsets that sum exactly to \\(T\\) (i.e., 12).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **DP Table Initialization:**  \n",
    "   - Create a DP table `dp[i][j]`, where:\n",
    "     - `i` ranges from 0 to `n` (number of elements).\n",
    "     - `j` ranges from 0 to `T` (target sum).\n",
    "   - **Base Case:**  \n",
    "     - `dp[0][0] = 1` (There is one way to achieve a sum of 0: the empty subset).\n",
    "     - `dp[0][j] = 0` for all \\(j > 0\\).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Fill the DP Table:**  \n",
    "   For each element \\( i \\) (from 1 to \\( n \\)) and for each sum \\( j \\) (from 0 to \\( T \\)):\n",
    "   - If \\( \\text{arr}[i-1] \\leq j \\):\n",

    "- **DP Table Construction:**  \n",
