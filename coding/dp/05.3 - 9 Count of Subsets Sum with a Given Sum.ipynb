    "# Comprehensive Handout: Count of Subsets Sum with a Given Sum\n",
    "\n",
    "In this problem, you are given an array of positive integers and a target sum. Your goal is to count the number of subsets of the array whose elements add up exactly to the target sum. This is a classic variation of the Subset Sum problem that uses dynamic programming (DP) to efficiently count the solutions.\n",

    "### Problem Statement\n",
    "Given an array of positive integers and a target sum, determine the number of subsets that can be formed such that the sum of the subset is exactly equal to the target sum.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Input\n",
    "- **Array:** An array of positive integers, e.g., `[2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 10]`.\n",
    "- **Target Sum:** An integer representing the sum to achieve, e.g., `10`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Output\n",
    "- **Count:** An integer representing the number of subsets whose elements sum to the target.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Detailed Example\n",
    "**Input:**\n",
    "- Array = `[2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 10]`\n",
    "- Target Sum = `10`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Output:**\n",
    "- **Count = 3**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "Possible subsets that sum to 10 are:\n",
    "- `[2, 3, 5]` → 2 + 3 + 5 = 10  \n",
    "- `[2, 8]` → 2 + 8 = 10  \n",
    "- `[10]` → 10\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, the total number of subsets is 3.\n",

    "### Why Is This Problem a DP Problem?\n",
    "- **Binary Choice for Each Element:**  \n",
    "  For every element in the array, you have a decision: **include** it in the subset or **exclude** it. This is similar to the 0/1 knapsack pattern.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Overlapping Subproblems & Optimal Substructure:**  \n",
    "  The same subproblems (e.g., count of subsets for a given target using a prefix of the array) are solved repeatedly. DP avoids redundant calculations by storing intermediate results.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Transformation from Subset Sum:**  \n",
    "  Instead of simply checking for the presence of a subset (as in the basic Subset Sum problem), you count the number of ways to achieve the target sum. This small tweak converts a decision problem into a counting problem.\n",

    "1. **Initialization:**\n",
    "   - Let `n` be the number of elements in the array.\n",
    "   - Create a 2D DP table `dp[n+1][target+1]` where `dp[i][j]` represents the number of subsets using the first `i` elements that sum to `j`.\n",
    "   - **Base Cases:**\n",
    "     - For any `i`, `dp[i][0] = 1` (the empty subset always sums to 0).\n",
    "     - For `j > 0`, `dp[0][j] = 0` (with 0 items, no positive sum can be formed).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **DP Table Filling (Recurrence):**\n",
    "   - For each item index `i` from 1 to `n`:\n",
    "     - For each sum `j` from 1 to `target`:\n",
    "       - **If `arr[i-1]` is less than or equal to `j`:**\n",
    "         - `dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j] + dp[i-1][j - arr[i-1]]`\n",
    "         - This represents the count when excluding the item plus the count when including the item.\n",

    "         - `dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j]` (item cannot be included).\n",
