    "# Comprehensive Handout: Minimum Subset Sum Difference Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Minimum Subset Sum Difference Problem** asks you to partition an array of positive integers into two subsets such that the absolute difference between their sums is minimized. This problem is a natural candidate for Dynamic Programming (DP) as it shares key similarities with the Subset Sum problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. IP–OP–PS (Input, Output, Problem Statement)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem Statement\n",
    "Given an array of positive integers, partition the array into two subsets such that the absolute difference between the sums of these subsets is minimized. In other words, if one subset sums to _x_ and the other to _(totalSum - x)_, we want to minimize |(totalSum - x) - x|.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Input\n",
    "- **Array:** A list of positive integers (e.g., `[1, 6, 11, 5]`).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Output\n",
    "- **Minimum Difference:** An integer representing the minimum absolute difference between the sums of the two subsets.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Detailed Example\n",
    "**Input:**  \n",
    "`[1, 6, 11, 5]`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Process:**  \n",
    "- Compute Total Sum, **range** = 1 + 6 + 11 + 5 = 23  \n",
    "- Use a DP-based subset sum algorithm to determine all achievable subset sums from 0 to 23.  \n",
    "- For each subset sum _x_ (where _x_ is achievable), the difference is calculated as |23 - 2×_x_|.  \n",
    "- The goal is to find the minimum such difference.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Output:**  \n",
    "`1`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**  \n",
    "One optimal partition is:  \n",
    "- Subset 1: `[1, 5, 6]` with sum = 12  \n",
    "- Subset 2: `[11]` with sum = 11  \n",
    "Thus, the minimum absolute difference is |12 - 11| = **1**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Identification\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Is This Problem a DP Problem?\n",
    "- **Reduction to Subset Sum:**  \n",
    "  The task is to find a subset of elements whose sum is as close as possible to half of the total sum. This is analogous to the classic Subset Sum problem.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Binary Decision per Element:**  \n",
    "  For each element, you decide whether to include it in the subset. This binary choice per element, with overlapping subproblems (i.e., whether a given sum can be achieved with a subset of the elements), makes DP an ideal solution technique.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Overlapping Subproblems:**  \n",
    "  Many subproblems, such as “Can we form a sum _j_ using the first _i_ elements?”, are solved repeatedly. Dynamic Programming avoids redundant calculations by storing results.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Cues\n",
    "- Total sum computation to determine the ideal target (_totalSum / 2_).\n",
    "- Recurrence relation similar to the 0/1 Knapsack or Subset Sum: include or exclude the current element.\n",
    "- Use of a DP table to record which subset sums are achievable.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Break Down → Dynamic Programming Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step-by-Step Subtasks\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Compute Total Sum (Range):**\n",
    "   - Sum all elements in the array. This sum will be used as the range for our DP table.\n",
    "  \n",
    "2. **DP Table Initialization (Subset Sum Variant):**\n",
    "   - Create a 2D DP matrix `t[n+1][sum+1]` where `t[i][j]` is a boolean indicating whether a subset of the first _i_ elements can form a sum of _j_.\n",
    "   - **Base Initialization:**\n",
    "     - For any _i_, `t[i][0] = true` (an empty subset gives a sum of 0).\n",
    "     - For _j > 0_, `t[0][j] = false` (with 0 elements, no positive sum is achievable).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Fill the DP Table:**\n",
    "   - For each element (from 1 to _n_) and for each sum (from 1 to _totalSum_), update the DP table:\n",
    "     - **If `arr[i-1] <= j`:**\n",
    "       - `t[i][j] = t[i-1][j - arr[i-1]] || t[i-1][j]`  \n",
    "         (Decide whether to include or exclude the current element.)\n",
    "     - **Else:**\n",
    "       - `t[i][j] = t[i-1][j]`  \n",
    "         (Exclude the element since it’s too large for the current sum.)\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Extract Possible Subset Sums and Compute Minimum Difference:**\n",
    "   - Traverse the last row (`t[n][j]`) to find all subset sums that are achievable.\n",
    "   - For each achievable subset sum _x_, compute the difference as `abs(totalSum - 2*x)`.\n",
    "   - The minimum such difference is the answer.\n",

    "\n",
    "- **Total Sum Calculation:**  \n",
    "  Calculate the total sum (range) of the array elements. This value determines the overall search space for possible subset sums.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **DP Table Construction:**  \n",
    "  A 2D boolean DP table `t` is constructed where each cell `t[i][j]` represents whether a subset of the first _i_ elements can form the sum _j_. This table is filled based on whether the current element is included or excluded.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Subset Sums Extraction:**  \n",
    "  After the DP table is fully populated, iterate over the final row to gather all achievable subset sums. These values represent potential candidates for one partition’s sum.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Calculating the Minimum Difference:**  \n",
    "  For each subset sum _x_, the difference between the two subsets is `abs(totalSum - 2*x)`. The smallest difference found is the solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Time Complexity:**  \n",
