    "# Comprehensive Handout: Subset Sum Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "Dynamic Programming (DP) can be used to solve the Subset Sum problem—a classic variation of the knapsack pattern. In this problem, you are given an array and a target sum, and you need to determine whether there exists a subset of the array that adds up exactly to the target. The answer is simply **Yes (true)** or **No (false)**.\n",

    "### Problem Statement\n",
    "Given an array of integers and a target sum, determine whether there exists a subset of the array whose elements sum up exactly to the target value.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Input\n",
    "- **Array:** An array of integers (e.g., [2, 3, 7, 8, 10]).\n",
    "- **Target Sum:** An integer representing the sum to be achieved (e.g., 11).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Output\n",
    "- **Boolean:** Output **true** (or \"YES\") if a subset exists that sums to the target, otherwise **false** (or \"NO\").\n",
    "\n",
    "### Detailed Example\n",
    "**Input:**\n",
    "- Array = [2, 3, 7, 8, 10]\n",
    "- Target Sum = 11\n",
    "\n",
    "**Output:**\n",
    "- **true**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "- One possible subset is [3, 8] since 3 + 8 = 11.  \n",
    "- If no such subset existed, the answer would be **false**.\n",

    "### Why Is This Problem a DP Problem (and a Variation of Knapsack)?\n",
    "- **Binary Choice for Each Element:**  \n",
    "  For every number in the array, you decide whether to include it in the subset or not. This is analogous to the include/exclude choice in the knapsack problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Optimal Substructure & Overlapping Subproblems:**  \n",
    "  The problem can be broken down into smaller subproblems:\n",
    "  - \"Is there a subset among the first _i_ elements that sums to _j_?\"\n",
    "  - These subproblems overlap because many different choices lead to the same remaining target sum.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Transformation from Knapsack:**  \n",
    "  Instead of maximizing profit, the goal here is to achieve an exact target sum. The DP solution for subset sum uses a similar table structure as the 0/1 knapsack but works with boolean values.\n",
