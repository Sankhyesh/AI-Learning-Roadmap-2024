    "# Dynamic Programming: Recursion, Memoization, and Tabulation\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. IP–OP–PS (Input, Output, Problem Statement)\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Problem Statement**\n",
    "\n",
    "In many coding interviews, especially at companies offering high salaries (e.g., Nutanix, Flipkart), you’re asked to solve problems involving **optimal** results (maximum, minimum, or largest) under certain **choices** (e.g., pick an item or not, partition the array in different ways). Such problems often exhibit **overlapping subproblems** when approached with recursion, making them prime candidates for **Dynamic Programming** (DP).\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Input**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Typically, some data (e.g., arrays, matrices) plus constraints (e.g., capacity, target sum) that require you to make **choices** leading to an **optimal** outcome.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Output**\n",
    "\n",
    "- The **best** (max/min/largest) result you can achieve under the given constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Detailed Example**\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the **Knapsack Problem** as a concrete illustration:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Input**: \n",
    "  - An integer \\(n\\) (number of items).  \n",
    "  - Arrays of size \\(n\\) representing `weights` and `values`.  \n",
    "  - An integer `W` (knapsack capacity).\n",
    "- **Question**:  \n",
    "  “What is the **maximum** total value we can fit into the knapsack without exceeding capacity `W`?”\n",
    "\n",
    "**Output**: A single integer (the maximum total value).\n",
    "\n",
    "A naive recursive solution calls itself twice per item (“include or exclude”), leading to exponential time. By storing intermediate results (memoization or tabulation), we reduce the complexity to a polynomial time solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Identification\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Why Is This a DP Candidate?**\n",
    "\n",
    "From the transcript, **DP** is identified by two major cues:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Choice**  \n",
    "   - For instance, in Knapsack: “include the item or exclude it.”  \n",
    "   - In general, we see branching recursion with multiple calls per state.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Optimality**  \n",
    "   - The problem asks for a “maximum,” “minimum,” or “largest” result.  \n",
    "   - Example: “maximum profit,” “minimum cost,” “largest sum,” etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Whenever you see **choices** + **optimal** result + **two or more recursive calls** leading to repeated subproblems, it strongly suggests **DP**.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Key Insight**:  \n",
    "> “DP is enhanced recursion.” Start with **pure recursion**. Then, if subproblems repeat, apply **memoization** (top-down) or **tabulation** (bottom-up).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Break Down → Recursive, Top-Down, and Bottom-Up\n",
    "\n",
    "Below we show how to solve a DP problem in **three** ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Recursive (Plain Recursion)**  \n",
    "2. **Top-Down (Memoization)**  \n",
    "3. **Bottom-Up (Tabulation)**  \n",
    "\n",
    "We’ll use a **Knapsack**-style example, but the logic generalizes to other DP problems (Matrix Chain Multiplication, LCS, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.1 Recursive (Plain Recursion)\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Definition**:  \n",
    "   - Write a function `f(idx, capacity)` that returns the maximum value using items up to index `idx` with remaining capacity `capacity`.\n",
    "2. **Base Case**:  \n",
    "   - If `idx < 0` or `capacity == 0`, return 0 (no items or no capacity).\n",
    "3. **Choice**:  \n",
    "   - If the weight of the current item `weights[idx]` is **more** than `capacity`, we **cannot** include it.  \n",
    "   - Otherwise, we have two sub-choices:\n",
    "     1. **Include** the item → add its value + solve subproblem with `idx-1, capacity - weights[idx]`.\n",
    "     2. **Exclude** the item → skip it, solve subproblem with `idx-1, capacity`.\n",
    "4. **Recursive Formula**:  \n",
    "   \\[\n",
    "   f(idx, capacity) = \\begin{cases}\n",
    "     0 & \\text{if } idx < 0 \\text{ or } capacity \\le 0,\\\\\n",
    "     f(idx - 1, capacity) & \\text{if } weights[idx] > capacity,\\\\\n",
    "     \\max\\bigl(\\text{value}[idx] + f(idx - 1, capacity - weights[idx]),\\, f(idx - 1, capacity)\\bigr) & \\text{otherwise.}\n",
    "   \\end{cases}\n",
    "   \\]\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.2 Top-Down (Memoization)\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Observation**:  \n",
    "   - The recursive approach calls the same `(idx, capacity)` multiple times.  \n",
    "   - We can store (memoize) the result of `f(idx, capacity)` in a 2D array `dp[idx][capacity]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Algorithm**:\n",
    "   - Before computing `f(idx, capacity)`, check if `dp[idx][capacity]` is **already computed**. If yes, return it.  \n",
    "   - Otherwise, compute via recursion, store the result in `dp[idx][capacity]`, then return it.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Complexity**:\n",
    "   - Each state `(idx, capacity)` is computed **once**.  \n",
    "   - For Knapsack, complexity becomes **O(n * W)**, where `n` is number of items, `W` is capacity.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.3 Bottom-Up (Tabulation)\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Iterative Table**:\n",
    "   - Create a 2D table `dp[n+1][W+1]` where `dp[i][w]` represents the maximum value using items up to `i` with capacity `w`.\n",
    "2. **Initialization**:\n",
    "   - `dp[0..n][0] = 0` → if capacity is 0, no value.  \n",
    "   - `dp[0][0..W] = 0` → if no items, no value.\n",
    "3. **Filling the Table**:\n",
    "   - For each item `i` from 1..n:\n",
    "     - For each capacity `w` from 1..W:\n",
    "       - If `weights[i-1] <= w`, \n",
    "         \\[\n",
    "           dp[i][w] = \\max\\Bigl(\\text{values}[i-1] + dp[i-1][w - weights[i-1]},\\, dp[i-1][w]\\Bigr).\n",
    "         \\]\n",
    "       - Else,\n",
    "         \\[\n",
    "           dp[i][w] = dp[i-1][w].\n",
    "         \\]\n",
    "4. **Result**:\n",
    "   - `dp[n][W]` is the maximum value.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important**: The transcript strongly emphasizes that you **should not** jump directly into bottom-up. Start with **recursion**, then either add **memoization** or convert to **tabulation**. This ensures you fully understand the subproblems.\n",
