    "# Knapsack Pattern and Its 6 Common Variations\n",
    "\n",
    "Dynamic Programming (DP) often revolves around the **knapsack pattern**—deciding for each element whether to include it or exclude it in a subset (or knapsack). By making small modifications to the base 0/1 Knapsack approach, you can solve several related problems:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Subset Sum**  \n",
    "2. **Equal Sum Partition**  \n",
    "3. **Count of Subset Sum**  \n",
    "4. **Minimum Subset Sum Difference**  \n",

    "## 1. IP–OP–PS (Input, Output, Problem Statement)\n",
    "\n",
    "### General Knapsack Problem Statement\n",
    "You have an array of integers (items), each with an associated “cost” (weight) and a “benefit” (value). You want to pick a subset of these items so that the total cost doesn’t exceed a limit (capacity), and the total benefit (profit) is maximized.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, each of the **6 common variations** modifies the “benefit” or the “capacity” concept in small ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Subset Sum**  \n",
    "   - **Input:** An array of integers, plus a target sum.  \n",
    "   - **Output:** Whether any subset sums to the target (boolean).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Equal Sum Partition**  \n",
    "   - **Input:** An array of integers.  \n",
    "   - **Output:** Whether the array can be partitioned into two subsets of equal sum (boolean).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Count of Subset Sum**  \n",
    "   - **Input:** An array of integers, plus a target sum.  \n",
    "   - **Output:** The count of different subsets whose sum is exactly the target.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Minimum Subset Sum Difference**  \n",
    "   - **Input:** An array of integers.  \n",
    "   - **Output:** The minimum possible difference between the sums of two subsets.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Target Sum** (LeetCode)  \n",
    "   - **Input:** An array of integers and a target value. You can add + or – signs in front of each integer to form an expression.  \n",
    "   - **Output:** The number of ways to assign signs such that the resulting sum equals the target.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Number of Subsets with a Given Difference**  \n",
    "   - **Input:** An array of integers and a specific difference value.  \n",
    "   - **Output:** The count of subset pairs whose difference is exactly that value.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each problem has its own “knapsack capacity” and “profit” interpretation, but they all revolve around the **same choice** pattern: include or exclude an element.\n",
    "\n",

    "## 2. Identification\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Are These Problems Variations of 0/1 Knapsack?\n",
    "- **Binary Choice:**  \n",
    "  For each element, you decide whether to **include** it in a subset or **exclude** it.\n",
    "- **Optimal Substructure / Overlapping Subproblems:**  \n",
    "  All 6 problems break down into smaller subproblems (subsets of an array with reduced capacity or target). This approach naturally leads to DP solutions.\n",
    "- **Minor Tweaks to the Base Recurrence:**  \n",
    "  The code structure is almost the same for all, but the final “goal” (e.g., checking if sum == target, or counting ways, or finding min difference) changes how you interpret or store DP results.\n",

    "   - **DP Table:** `dp[i][j]` = boolean, indicating whether a subset of the first `i` elements can sum to `j`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Equal Sum Partition**  \n",
    "   - **Goal:** Check if the array can be partitioned into two subsets of equal sum.  \n",

    "3. **Count of Subset Sum**  \n",
    "   - **Goal:** Count the number of subsets that sum to a given target.  \n",

    "\n",
    "4. **Minimum Subset Sum Difference**  \n",
    "   - **Goal:** Split the array into two subsets with the minimum difference of sums.  \n",
    "   - **Trick:** Use the **Subset Sum** approach to find possible sums up to `S/2`. The difference is minimized by picking the sum that’s as close to `S/2` as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Target Sum** (LeetCode)  \n",
    "   - **Goal:** Number of ways to assign +/– signs so that the resulting sum equals a target.  \n",

    "\n",
    "6. **Number of Subsets with a Given Difference**  \n",
    "   - **Goal:** Count the subsets whose difference between sums of two subsets is a specific value.  \n",
    "   - **Trick:** If difference = `d`, total sum = `S`. One subset has sum `(S + d)/2`. Reduce to **Count of Subset Sum** with target `(S + d)/2`.\n",

    "- **Core Knapsack Recurrence:**  \n",
    "  At index `i`, if the current element can be used to build up the sum/capacity, you can include or exclude it.  \n",
    "  - `dp[i][j]` often tracks whether `j` can be formed (boolean) or how many ways `j` can be formed (integer), etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Minor Adjustments:**  \n",
    "  - For **Subset Sum** and **Equal Sum Partition**, store booleans (true/false).  \n",
    "  - For **Count of Subset Sum**, store counts.  \n",
    "  - For **Minimum Subset Sum Difference**, first use subset sum logic to find all possible sums up to `S/2`. Then pick the sum that yields the minimum difference.  \n",
    "  - For **Target Sum** and **# of Subsets with a Given Difference**, transform the difference requirement into a suitable subset sum target.\n",
