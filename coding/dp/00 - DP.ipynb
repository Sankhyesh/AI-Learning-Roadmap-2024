    "# Dynamic Programming Notes\n",
    "\n",
    "Dynamic Programming (DP) is one of the most powerful techniques in algorithm design. It’s not just about filling in tables; it’s about understanding the underlying recursive structure and then enhancing it to avoid redundant work.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Introduction to DP\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Dynamic Programming is Awesome!**  \n",
    "  - It deepens your problem-solving skills and is highly valued in technical interviews.\n",
    "  - Top companies (e.g., Nutanix, Flipkart) frequently ask DP questions—sometimes variations of classic problems like Matrix Chain Multiplication.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Real-World Impact:**  \n",
    "  - For example, a DP question on a derivative of Matrix Chain Multiplication was asked at Nutanix, which offered high packages.  \n",
    "  - Even if you miss one opportunity, mastering DP opens doors to other high-paying roles.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. What Exactly Is DP?\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Enhanced Recursion:**  \n",
    "  - DP is “enhanced recursion” — it is recursion with storage (memoization) to avoid recalculating overlapping subproblems.\n",
    "  - **Key Phrase:** “DP is enhanced recursion.”\n",
    "\n",
    "### Diagram: Basic Recursion Tree with Overlapping Subproblems\n",
    "\n",
    "Below is an example of a recursion tree for the Fibonacci sequence (a classic DP problem). Notice how some subproblems are computed multiple times:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "            fib(4)\n",
    "           /      \\\n",
    "      fib(3)       fib(2)\n",
    "      /    \\         /   \\\n",
    " fib(2)  fib(1)   fib(1)  fib(0)\n",
    "   /   \\\n",
    "fib(1) fib(0)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "*Overlapping subproblems are highlighted by repeated calls (e.g., fib(2) and fib(1) appear more than once).*\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Two Main Flavors:**\n",
    "  1. **Memoization (Top-Down):**  \n",
    "     - Write a recursive solution.\n",
    "     - Store results of subproblems in a cache to reuse later.\n",
    "  2. **Tabulation (Bottom-Up):**  \n",
    "     - Build a table iteratively based on the recurrence relation.\n",
    "     - **Important:** Understand the recursion first before jumping directly to tabulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Remember:**  \n",
    "  - The parent of DP is recursion. If you can’t derive the recursive solution from scratch, you won’t fully grasp DP.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Identifying DP Problems\n",
    "\n",
    "### Look for Two Key Indicators:\n",
    "1. **Choices:**  \n",
    "   - DP problems typically give you a decision at each step (e.g., include an item or not in knapsack).\n",
    "   - **Example:**  \n",
    "     - In knapsack, you choose to either include an item or skip it.\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. **Optimality:**  \n",
    "   - The problem asks for something optimal—like maximum profit, minimum cost, longest subsequence, etc.\n",
    "   - **Examples:**  \n",
    "     - Maximum Profit, Minimum Cost, Longest Common Subsequence (LCS).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Diagram: Identifying Overlapping Subproblems\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine a recursive function with multiple recursive calls:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "function solve(n):\n",
    "    if n is small: return base_value\n",
    "    else:\n",
    "        return solve(n-1) + solve(n-2)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "When you visualize the recursion tree, if you see multiple branches leading to the same subproblem (e.g., solve(n-2) being computed more than once), then overlapping occurs and DP is beneficial.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Tip:**  \n",
    "  - **One Recursive Call:** Likely no overlapping subproblems → DP might not be necessary.\n",
    "  - **Two or More Recursive Calls:** There is a high chance of overlapping, making DP applicable.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Approach to Solving DP Problems\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step-by-Step Strategy:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Start with a Recursive Solution:**\n",
    "   - Write a clear recursive solution that defines the problem in terms of smaller subproblems.\n",
    "   - Identify the base cases and the recursive relation.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Memoize the Recursive Solution:**\n",
    "   - Once you have the recursive solution, add a cache (using an array, dictionary, etc.) to store computed results.\n",
    "   - This step transforms the exponential recursive solution into an efficient DP solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Convert to Tabulation (if needed):**\n",
    "   - Build a DP table based on your recursion.\n",
    "   - **Caution:**  \n",
    "     - Do not jump directly to tabulation without understanding the recursive structure. Many tutorials start with tabulation, but it is much more effective to build from recursion.\n",

    "- **Tabulation:**  \n",
    "  - Fill a table iteratively.\n",
