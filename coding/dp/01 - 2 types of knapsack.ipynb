    "# Knapsack and Its Variations – Dynamic Programming Notes\n",
    "\n",
    "Dynamic Programming (DP) is a systematic technique to optimize recursive solutions by storing (memoizing) intermediate results. Knapsack problems are among the most popular DP problems, and mastering them gives you the foundation to solve many variations.\n",

    "There are **three primary types** of knapsack problems:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Fractional Knapsack**  \n",
    "   - **Approach:** Greedy  \n",
    "   - **Key Idea:** You can take fractions of an item.  \n",

    "\n",
    "2. **0/1 Knapsack**  \n",
    "   - **Approach:** Dynamic Programming  \n",
    "   - **Key Idea:** Each item can be taken **at most once** (either the whole item or not at all).  \n",
    "   - **Variations:** By making minor changes in the code, you can solve:\n",

    "\n",
    "**Problem Statement:**  \n",
    "Given a set of items, each with a weight and a value, and a knapsack with a weight capacity, choose a subset of items to maximize the total profit while keeping the total weight within the capacity.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**  \n",
    "- **Items:**  \n",
    "  - Brick: Weight = 2 kg, Value = ₹10  \n",
    "  - Laptop: Weight = 1 kg, Value = ₹1000  \n",
    "- **Knapsack Capacity:** 7 kg  \n",
    "- **Goal:** Choose items such that total weight ≤ 7 kg and total value is maximized.\n",

    "\n",
    "By tweaking the recursive recurrence or the initialization conditions, you can solve several related problems:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Subset Sum:**  \n",
    "   - **Goal:** Determine if there is a subset with a sum equal to a target.\n",
    "   - **Modification:** Instead of maximizing value, check for equality with the target sum.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Equal Sum Partition:**  \n",
    "   - **Goal:** Partition an array into two subsets with equal sum.\n",
    "   - **Modification:** Reduce to a subset sum problem with the target being half the total sum.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Count of Subset Sum:**  \n",
    "   - **Goal:** Count the number of subsets that add up to a target sum.\n",
    "   - **Modification:** Instead of returning a boolean or maximum value, count the valid ways.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Minimum Subset Sum Difference:**  \n",
    "   - **Goal:** Partition the array such that the difference between the subset sums is minimized.\n",
    "   - **Modification:** Calculate the sum difference for each valid partition and track the minimum.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Target Sum:**  \n",
    "   - **Goal:** Find the number of ways to assign + or – signs to make the expression equal a target sum.\n",
    "   - **Modification:** A variation of the count of subset sum with adjusted target and sign considerations.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Number of Subsets with Given Difference:**  \n",
    "   - **Goal:** Count subsets such that the difference between the sums of two subsets equals a given value.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. **Write the Recursive Solution:**\n",

    "   - Write the recurrence that captures the “include or exclude” decision.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Memoize the Recursive Solution (Top-Down DP):**\n",
    "   - Introduce a cache (e.g., 2D array) to store results for each subproblem.\n",
    "   - This avoids recalculating the same subproblems.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Optional: Convert to Tabulation (Bottom-Up DP):**\n",
    "   - Build a DP table iteratively based on the recursive relation.\n",
    "   - **Caution:** Only do this once the recursive logic is well understood.\n",

    "## 6. Final Thoughts\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Master the 0/1 Knapsack:**  \n",
    "  - Understanding 0/1 knapsack thoroughly (including its recursive structure) empowers you to handle its six common variations.\n",
    "  - Once you can write the recursive solution, minor modifications will let you solve subset sum, equal sum partition, and other variations.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **DP is Recursion Plus Storage:**  \n",
    "  - Always start by writing the recursive solution. Then, enhance it with memoization or tabulation.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Practice Identification:**  \n",
    "  - Look for problems where you have a choice and an optimality condition. This is your cue for a DP approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Real-World Impact:**  \n",
    "  - Knapsack problems and their variations are commonly asked in technical interviews. A deep understanding will not only help you in interviews but also in solving a wide array of problems.\n",
