    "\n",
    "### 1.1 Problem Statement\n",
    "You are given a set of **n** items where each item has a corresponding weight and value. You have an unlimited supply of each item type. The objective is to determine the **maximum total value** obtainable by placing items into a knapsack without exceeding its capacity **W**. Unlike the 0/1 Knapsack, you may pick the same item multiple times. \n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2 Input Specification\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Format and Structure:**\n",
    "  - **n**: An integer representing the number of available items.\n",
    "  - **wt[]**: An array (or list) of **n** integers where each integer denotes the weight of an item.\n",
    "  - **val[]**: An array (or list) of **n** integers where each integer denotes the value of an item.\n",
    "  - **W**: An integer representing the maximum capacity of the knapsack.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Constraints:**\n",
    "  - 1 ≤ n ≤ *a reasonable upper bound* (e.g., 10<sup>2</sup>–10<sup>3</sup> for DP solutions)\n",
    "  - 1 ≤ wt[i] ≤ W (typically, though sometimes there could be items with weight greater than capacity)\n",
    "  - 0 ≤ val[i] (values are typically non-negative)\n",
    "  - 0 ≤ W ≤ *some maximum capacity* (depends on the problem context)\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Edge Cases:**\n",
    "  - **n = 0**: No items available. (Result should be 0.)\n",
    "  - **W = 0**: Knapsack has no capacity. (Result should be 0.)\n",
    "  - **All items weigh more than W**: No item can be added, so the answer is 0.\n",
    "  - **Single-element inputs** and cases with duplicate weights/values.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.3 Output Specification\n",
    "The output is a **single integer**, which is the maximum value that can be achieved given the constraints. This integer is the result stored at `t[n][W]` in the DP (dynamic programming) table.\n",

    "## 2. Identification\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.1 Why This Algorithm/Technique?\n",
    "- **Dynamic Programming (DP)** is chosen because the problem has **overlapping subproblems** and an **optimal substructure**. This means the optimal solution for a given capacity can be constructed from solutions of smaller capacities.\n",
    "- Specifically, since each item can be used repeatedly, the recurrence relation uses the same row in the DP table after including the item (i.e., `t[i][j - wt[i-1]]`) rather than moving to a previous row.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.2 Key Cues/Characteristics\n",
    "- The fact that an item can be chosen multiple times signals the use of **unbounded** knapsack logic.\n",
    "- The recurrence relation:  \n",
    "  ```cpp\n",
    "  t[i][j] = max(val[i-1] + t[i][j - wt[i-1]], t[i-1][j]);\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "  – Notice the reuse of the current row `t[i]` on the left-hand side when including an item; this is the hallmark of the unbounded knapsack.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.3 Alternative Approaches\n",
    "- **Recursive Approach with Memoization:**  \n",
    "  You could solve the problem recursively by reducing the capacity and memoizing the results to avoid recomputation.  \n",
    "- **1D DP Optimization:**  \n",
    "  Since the recurrence only needs the current and previous states in a specific way, you can optimize space by maintaining a one-dimensional DP array.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.4 Trade-off Analysis\n",
    "- **Time Complexity:**  \n",
    "  The implemented solution runs in O(n*W) time. Both the recursive approach (with proper memoization) and the iterative DP method have similar worst-case time bounds, but the iterative solution is usually more space-efficient and simpler to understand in this context.\n",
    "- **Space Complexity:**  \n",
    "  The solution uses a 2D DP table of size (n+1) x (W+1). A 1D optimization could reduce space usage to O(W).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.5 Justification\n",
    "The dynamic programming approach is well-suited given that:\n",
    "- It clearly manages overlapping subproblems.\n",
    "- The straightforward table filling (bottom-up) fits within typical input sizes.\n",
    "- It directly handles the \"infinite supply\" property by reusing the current state within the same row.\n",
