    "# Comprehensive Handout: 0/1 Knapsack Problem – Recursive Code\n",
    "\n",
    "Dynamic Programming (DP) is built upon recursion by adding storage to avoid redundant work. In the 0/1 Knapsack problem, you decide for each item whether to include it (if it fits) or not. In this handout, we first write the recursive solution for the 0/1 Knapsack problem, which serves as the parent for many DP variations.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Problem Statement\n",
    "Given a set of items—each with a weight and a value—and a knapsack with a fixed capacity, determine the maximum profit that can be achieved by choosing a subset of the items such that the total weight does not exceed the knapsack’s capacity. In the 0/1 Knapsack problem, each item is either taken as a whole or not taken at all (no fractions).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Input\n",
    "- **n:** Number of items.\n",
    "- **Weights Array:** An array `W[]` where `W[i]` is the weight of the *i*-th item.\n",
    "- **Values Array:** An array `V[]` where `V[i]` is the profit of the *i*-th item.\n",
    "- **Capacity (W):** Maximum weight that the knapsack can carry.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Output\n",
    "- **Maximum Profit:** An integer representing the maximum profit obtainable.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Detailed Example\n",
    "**Input:**\n",
    "- n = 4  \n",
    "- Weights: [2, 1, 3, 2]  \n",
    "- Values: [12, 10, 20, 15]  \n",
    "- Knapsack Capacity: 5\n",
    "\n",
    "**Output:**\n",
    "- Maximum Profit = 37\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "One optimal selection is to include items 1, 2, and 4:\n",
    "- Total weight = 2 + 1 + 2 = 5  \n",
    "- Total profit = 12 + 10 + 15 = 37\n",

    "\n",
    "### Why Is This Problem a Candidate for Recursion and DP?\n",
    "- **Choice:**  \n",
    "  For each item, you decide whether to **include** it or **exclude** it from the knapsack.\n",
    "- **Optimality:**  \n",
    "  The goal is to maximize the total profit, which is an optimality condition.\n",
    "- **Overlapping Subproblems:**  \n",
    "  A naive recursive solution repeatedly solves the same subproblems (e.g., with the same remaining capacity and items), making it ideal for applying DP through memoization.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Cues from the Transcript\n",
    "- The recursive solution involves **choice diagrams** that outline whether to add the item (if its weight is ≤ current capacity) or not.\n",
    "- The base condition is derived from the smallest valid input: if there are no items or if the capacity is 0, the profit is 0.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Step-by-Step Subtasks\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initialization:**\n",
    "   - Define a recursive function `knapsack(n, W)` with inputs:\n",
    "     - Weight array, value array, current capacity (`W`), and number of items (`n`).\n",
    "   - The return type is `int` (maximum profit).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Base Condition:**\n",
    "   - If there are no items left (`n == 0`) or if the knapsack capacity is zero (`W == 0`), then return 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Choice Diagram (Recursive Decision):**\n",
    "   - **If the weight of the last item is less than or equal to the capacity:**\n",
    "     - **Include it:**  \n",
    "       Profit = `value[n-1] + knapsack(n-1, W - weight[n-1])`\n",
    "     - **Exclude it:**  \n",
    "       Profit = `knapsack(n-1, W)`\n",
    "     - Return the maximum of these two choices.\n",
    "   - **If the weight of the last item is greater than the capacity:**\n",
    "     - You cannot include the item, so simply return `knapsack(n-1, W)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Data Structures:**\n",
    "   - **Input Arrays:** For weights and values.\n",
    "   - **Recursive Call Stack:** To handle the “include” or “exclude” decision.\n",
    "   - **(Optional) DP Table:** In a later stage, memoize results to optimize overlapping subproblems.\n",

    "- **Recursive Structure:**  \n",
    "  The function reduces the problem by considering one item at a time. For each item (starting from the last), it decides whether to include or exclude it.\n",
    "- **Base Conditions:**  \n",
    "  When `n == 0` (no items left) or `W == 0` (no capacity left), the function returns 0 profit.\n",
    "- **Choice Decisions:**  \n",
    "  - **Include the Item:**  \n",
    "    Only if the current item fits in the remaining capacity.\n",
