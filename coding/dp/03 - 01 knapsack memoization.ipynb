    "# Comprehensive Handout: 0/1 Knapsack Memoization\n",
    "\n",
    "Dynamic Programming (DP) is “enhanced recursion” — it solves problems by breaking them into subproblems and storing their solutions to avoid redundant computations. In the 0/1 Knapsack problem, each item must either be taken as a whole or not at all. This handout focuses on converting a recursive solution to a memoized (top-down) DP solution for the 0/1 Knapsack problem.\n",

    "## 1. IP–OP–PS (Input, Output, Problem Statement)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem Statement\n",
    "Given a set of items, each with a weight and a value, and a knapsack with a fixed capacity, determine the maximum profit that can be achieved by selecting items such that the total weight does not exceed the knapsack's capacity. In the 0/1 Knapsack problem, an item can either be included or excluded.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Input\n",
    "- **n:** Number of items.\n",
    "- **Weights Array:** `W[]`, where `W[i]` is the weight of the *i*-th item.\n",
    "- **Values Array:** `V[]`, where `V[i]` is the profit of the *i*-th item.\n",
    "- **Capacity (C):** Maximum weight the knapsack can hold.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Output\n",
    "- **Maximum Profit:** An integer representing the maximum profit obtainable without exceeding the capacity.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Detailed Example\n",
    "**Input:**\n",
    "- n = 4  \n",
    "- Weights: [2, 1, 3, 2]  \n",
    "- Values: [12, 10, 20, 15]  \n",
    "- Capacity: 5\n",
    "\n",
    "**Output:**\n",
    "- Maximum Profit = 37\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "An optimal solution is to select items 1, 2, and 4:\n",
    "- Total weight = 2 + 1 + 2 = 5  \n",
    "- Total profit = 12 + 10 + 15 = 37\n",

    "### Why Use Memoization for the 0/1 Knapsack?\n",
    "- **Binary Choice:**  \n",
    "  For each item, you decide whether to include it or not.\n",
    "- **Optimal Substructure:**  \n",
    "  The problem asks for maximum profit—a typical optimality condition.\n",
    "- **Overlapping Subproblems:**  \n",
    "  A recursive solution recalculates the same subproblems (e.g., same remaining capacity and item index) repeatedly. Memoization stores these intermediate results, avoiding redundant work.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Cues from the Transcript\n",
    "- **Choice Diagram:**  \n",
    "  Each item leads to a decision: if its weight fits, choose to include it (and reduce capacity) or exclude it.\n",
    "- **Base Condition:**  \n",
    "  When no items remain or capacity is zero, profit is zero.\n",
    "- **Enhanced Recursion:**  \n",
    "  DP is recursion enhanced with storage (memoization), ensuring that each unique subproblem is solved only once.\n",
