    "# Comprehensive Handout: 0/1 Knapsack – Bottom-Up DP (Tabulation)\n",
    "\n",
    "Dynamic Programming (DP) transforms recursive solutions into efficient algorithms by building a table (or matrix) that stores the results of subproblems. In the 0/1 Knapsack problem, the goal is to choose items to maximize profit without exceeding a fixed capacity, and the bottom‑up DP approach (tabulation) builds the solution iteratively.\n",

    "## 1. IP–OP–PS (Input, Output, Problem Statement)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem Statement\n",
    "Given a set of items, each with a weight and a value, and a knapsack with a fixed capacity, determine the maximum profit that can be obtained by selecting a subset of the items such that the total weight does not exceed the knapsack’s capacity. In the 0/1 Knapsack problem, an item can be taken as a whole or left behind (no fractions allowed).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Input\n",
    "- **n:** Number of items.\n",
    "- **Weights Array (W[]):** Where `W[i]` is the weight of the *i*-th item.\n",
    "- **Values Array (V[]):** Where `V[i]` is the profit of the *i*-th item.\n",
    "- **Capacity (C):** Maximum weight the knapsack can hold.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Output\n",
    "- **Maximum Profit:** An integer representing the highest profit obtainable without exceeding the capacity.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Detailed Example\n",
    "**Input:**\n",
    "- n = 4  \n",
    "- Weights: [2, 1, 3, 2]  \n",
    "- Values: [12, 10, 20, 15]  \n",
    "- Capacity: 5\n",
    "\n",
    "**Output:**\n",
    "- Maximum Profit = 37\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**  \n",
    "One optimal selection is to choose items 1, 2, and 4:\n",
    "- Total weight = 2 + 1 + 2 = 5  \n",

    "### Why Use DP for the 0/1 Knapsack Problem?\n",
    "- **Choice at Each Item:**  \n",
    "  For every item, you decide whether to include it or not.\n",
    "- **Optimal Substructure:**  \n",
    "  The optimal solution for the full problem is built from optimal solutions of its subproblems.\n",
    "- **Overlapping Subproblems:**  \n",
    "  A naive recursive solution will solve the same subproblems repeatedly (e.g., with the same remaining capacity and subset of items).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Points from the Transcript\n",
    "- **Recursive Choice Diagram:**  \n",
    "  If an item fits in the remaining capacity, you choose between including it (adding its value and reducing the capacity) or excluding it.\n",
    "- **Base Condition:**  \n",
    "  If no items remain or the capacity is zero, the profit is zero.\n",
    "- **Enhanced Recursion:**  \n",
    "  DP “enhances” recursion by storing subproblem results. While top‑down DP (memoization) does this recursively, bottom‑up DP (tabulation) iteratively fills a table.\n",
