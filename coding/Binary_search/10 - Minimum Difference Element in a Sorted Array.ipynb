    "# Minimum Difference Element in a Sorted Array Handout\n",
    "\n",
    "This handout explains how to find the element in a sorted array that has the minimum absolute difference with a given target value. In other words, given a target and a sorted array, the goal is to identify the element that is closest to the target. The efficient solution leverages binary search to narrow down the candidate elements, then compares their differences with the target.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Problem Statement\n",
    "Given a **sorted array** of integers and a target value, find the element in the array that has the minimum absolute difference with the target.  \n",
    "If there are two numbers with the same difference, a specific tie-breaking rule may be applied (for example, returning the smaller element).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Operations**:\n",
    "- **Locate** the potential candidate(s) using binary search.\n",
    "- **Compare** the differences between the target and its nearest neighbors.\n",
    "- **Return** the element with the smallest absolute difference.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Inputs\n",
    "- **Array**: A sorted list of integers (e.g., `[1, 3, 8, 10, 15]`).\n",
    "- **Target**: An integer value (e.g., `12`).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Outputs\n",
    "- A **single integer** representing the element in the array that is closest to the target.\n",

    "### Detailed Example\n",
    "\n",
    "**Sample Input**:\n",
    "```plaintext\n",
    "Array: [1, 3, 8, 10, 15]\n",
    "Target: 12\n",
    "```\n",

    "### Why Use Modified Binary Search?\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Sorted Array Advantage**:\n",
    "   - The array is sorted, so binary search can efficiently narrow down the potential candidate by locating the point where the target would be inserted.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Efficiency**:\n",
    "   - A naive linear scan would take O(n) time, but binary search reduces the search time to O(log n).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Key Cues**:\n",
    "   - The problem requires finding the closest element based on numerical difference.\n",
    "   - A sorted structure allows you to quickly identify the \"neighbors\" of the target — namely, the element immediately greater than or equal to the target (the ceiling) and the element immediately less than the target (the floor).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Break Down → Modified Binary Search Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step-by-Step Sub-Tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Binary Search to Locate the Insertion Point**:\n",
    "   - Initialize two pointers: `low = 0` and `high = n - 1`.\n",
    "   - Use binary search to determine the index where the target would be inserted.\n",
    "   - This gives you two candidate positions:\n",
    "     - One at index `low` (or the first element greater than or equal to the target).\n",
    "     - And the element just before this position (if it exists).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Compare Candidate Elements**:\n",
    "   - Compute the absolute difference between the target and the candidate at index `low`.\n",
    "   - Also, if `low > 0`, compute the difference for the element at index `low - 1`.\n",
    "   - Compare the differences and choose the element with the smallest difference.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Tie-Breaking** (if needed):\n",
    "   - In cases where both candidates are equally close, apply a tie-break rule (for example, return the smaller element).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Explanations + Code\n",
    "\n",
    "### Detailed Explanation\n",
    "- **Binary Search Phase**:\n",
    "  - The binary search helps identify the region where the target would fit in the sorted order.\n",
    "  - Once the appropriate index is found, the two candidates (the element at that index and its predecessor) are the only possibilities for the closest element.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Comparison Phase**:\n",
    "  - Calculate the absolute differences:\n",
    "    - `diff1 = |array[low] - target|`\n",
    "    - `diff2 = |array[low - 1] - target|` (if `low > 0`)\n",
    "  - Return the candidate with the smaller difference.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Time Complexity**:\n",
    "  - Binary search runs in **O(log n)** time and the comparison step takes constant time, yielding an overall time complexity of **O(log n)**.\n",
