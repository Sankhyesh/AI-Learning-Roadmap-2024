    "# Find Maximum Element in a Bitonic Array Handout\n",
    "\n",
    "A **bitonic array** is an array that first increases strictly to a maximum element and then decreases strictly. The goal of this problem is to find the maximum element efficiently using a modified binary search.\n",

    "\n",
    "## 1. IP–OP–PS (Input, Output, Problem Statement)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem Statement\n",
    "Given a **bitonic array** (i.e., an array that first increases then decreases), determine the maximum element in the array. The maximum element is the peak where the increasing sequence ends and the decreasing sequence begins.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Operations**:\n",
    "- **Identify** the turning point (peak) of the array.\n",
    "- **Return** the maximum element at the peak.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Inputs\n",
    "- **Array**: A bitonic array of integers (e.g., `[1, 3, 8, 12, 4, 2]`).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Outputs\n",
    "- A **single integer** representing the maximum element (e.g., `12`).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Detailed Example\n",
    "\n",
    "**Sample Input**:\n",
    "```plaintext\n",
    "Array: [1, 3, 8, 12, 4, 2]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Sample Output**:\n",
    "```plaintext\n",
    "Maximum Element: 12\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "*Explanation*:  \n",
    "The array increases until it reaches 12 and then decreases, so 12 is the maximum (peak) element.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Identification\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Use a Modified Binary Search?\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Unimodal Property**:\n",
    "   - A bitonic array is unimodal, meaning it increases to a single maximum point and then decreases. This characteristic guarantees the existence of a unique peak.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Efficiency**:\n",
    "   - A naive linear search takes O(n) time. However, by exploiting the unimodal property, a modified binary search can locate the peak in O(log n) time.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Key Cues**:\n",
    "   - The array's sorted-increasing and then decreasing nature suggests that once we find an element that is greater than its neighbors, it is the maximum.\n",
    "   - When an element is part of the increasing segment (i.e., less than its next element), the peak lies to the right; if it's part of the decreasing segment, the peak lies to the left.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Break Down → Modified Binary Search Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step-by-Step Sub-Tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initialization**:\n",
    "   - Set two pointers: `low = 0` and `high = n - 1`, where `n` is the number of elements in the array.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Binary Search Loop**:\n",
    "   - **Calculate Midpoint**:\n",
    "     - Compute `mid = low + (high - low) / 2`.\n",
    "   - **Check for Peak**:\n",
    "     - If `arr[mid]` is greater than or equal to both its neighbors (taking care of edge cases), then `arr[mid]` is the maximum.\n",
    "   - **Decision Making**:\n",
    "     - If `arr[mid]` is less than `arr[mid + 1]`, then the peak lies in the right half; update `low = mid + 1`.\n",
    "     - Otherwise (i.e., if `arr[mid]` is greater than `arr[mid + 1]`), the peak is in the left half or at `mid`; update `high = mid`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Termination**:\n",
    "   - When the search space narrows down to one element (`low == high`), that element is the maximum.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Explanations + Code\n",
    "\n",
    "### Detailed Explanation\n",
    "- **Initialization**:\n",
    "  - We start with the full array.\n",
    "- **Mid Calculation & Comparison**:\n",
    "  - At each iteration, calculate the middle index.\n",
    "  - If the middle element is less than its right neighbor, the peak lies to the right.\n",
    "  - Otherwise, the peak lies to the left or might be the current element.\n",
    "- **Edge Conditions**:\n",
    "  - Handle the boundaries carefully to avoid accessing invalid indices.\n",
    "- **Time Complexity**:\n",
    "  - Each iteration halves the search space, achieving a time complexity of O(log n).\n",
