    "\n",
    "This document explains the Binary Search algorithm, detailing the problem statement, why binary search is the right approach, a step-by-step breakdown, a C++ implementation, and an interactive animated visualization using Python.\n",

    "## 1. IP–OP–PS (Input, Output, Problem Statement)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem Statement\n",
    "Given a **sorted array** of elements and a target value, determine whether the target exists in the array. If it does, return its index; otherwise, return an indicator (such as `-1`) showing that the target is not present.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Operations**:\n",
    "- **Search** for the target element in a sorted array.\n",
    "- **Return** the index of the target if found.\n",
    "- **Indicate** failure (using `-1`) if the target is not present.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Inputs\n",
    "- **Array**: A sorted list of integers (or any comparable items).\n",
    "- **Target**: The value to search for within the array.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Outputs\n",
    "- An **integer** representing the index of the target element in the array if it is found.\n",
    "- `-1` if the target element is not present.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Detailed Example\n",
    "\n",
    "**Sample Input**:\n",
    "```plaintext\n",
    "Array: [1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13]\n",
    "Target: 7\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Sample Output**:\n",
    "```plaintext\n",
    "Index: 3\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "*Explanation*: The target `7` is located at index `3` in the array (using 0-based indexing).\n",

    "## 2. Identification\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Use Binary Search?\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Sorted Data**:  \n",
    "   - Binary Search is optimal when the data is already sorted. The precondition of sorted order allows us to discard half of the search space at each step.\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. **Efficiency**:  \n",
    "   - Instead of a linear search that takes O(n) time, Binary Search works in O(log n) time, which is highly efficient for large datasets.\n",
    "   \n",
    "3. **Key Cues**:\n",
    "   - **Sorted Array**: The problem explicitly provides or assumes a sorted array.\n",
    "   - **Search Operation**: The task is to locate an element quickly.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Break Down → Binary Search\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step-by-Step Sub-Tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initialization**:  \n",
    "   - Set two pointers: `low` (start of the array) and `high` (end of the array).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Iterative Process**:\n",
    "   - **While Loop Condition**: Continue the search while `low <= high`.\n",
    "   - **Calculate Midpoint**:  \n",
    "     - Compute `mid = low + (high - low) / 2` to prevent overflow.\n",
    "   - **Compare Target with Middle Element**:\n",
    "     - **If** `array[mid]` equals the target, return `mid`.\n",
    "     - **Else if** `array[mid]` is less than the target, update `low = mid + 1`.\n",
    "     - **Else** (if `array[mid]` is greater than the target), update `high = mid - 1`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Termination**:  \n",
    "   - If the loop terminates without returning, the target is not present in the array. Return `-1`.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Data Structures Used**:\n",
    "   - An **array** (or vector) to hold the sorted data.\n",
    "   - **Pointers/Indices** (`low`, `mid`, `high`) to navigate through the array.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Explanations + Code\n",
    "\n",
    "### Detailed Explanation\n",
    "1. **Initialization**:  \n",
    "   - You begin by setting `low` to the first index (0) and `high` to the last index (`n-1`).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Loop and Mid Calculation**:  \n",
    "   - Within the loop, the middle index is calculated.  \n",
    "   - The target is compared with the middle element:\n",
    "     - If they match, the search is successful.\n",
    "     - If the target is larger, the search continues in the right half.\n",
    "     - If the target is smaller, the search continues in the left half.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Time Complexity**:  \n",
    "   - The algorithm divides the search space by 2 with each iteration, leading to a time complexity of **O(log n)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### C++ Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "```cpp\n",
    "#include <iostream>\n",

    "    \n",
    "    return 0;\n",

    "**Explanation**:\n",
    "- **Initialization**: `low` and `high` set to the bounds of the array.\n",
    "- **While Loop**: Continues while there is a valid search space.\n",
    "- **Mid Calculation**: Uses `low + (high - low) / 2` to avoid overflow.\n",
