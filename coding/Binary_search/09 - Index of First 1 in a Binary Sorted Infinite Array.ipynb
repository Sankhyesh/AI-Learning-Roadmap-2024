    "# Index of First 1 in a Binary Sorted Infinite Array Handout\n",
    "\n",
    "In this problem, you are given an infinite sorted binary array—that is, an array that consists of a sequence of 0’s followed by 1’s. The goal is to determine the index of the first occurrence of 1. Because the array is \"infinite,\" we cannot rely on knowing its length; instead, we first expand our search range exponentially until we find a 1, and then perform a modified binary search within that range.\n",

    "## 1. IP–OP–PS (Input, Output, Problem Statement)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem Statement\n",
    "Given an **infinite sorted binary array** (containing only 0's followed by 1's), find the index of the first occurrence of 1.  \n",
    "Since the array is infinite (or its size is unknown), you first need to identify a finite window where the first 1 lies by expanding the search range exponentially, and then use binary search within that window to locate the first 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Operations**:\n",
    "- **Range Expansion**: Start with a small window and double it until you encounter a 1.\n",
    "- **Binary Search**: Once a window is determined (with low index containing 0 and high index containing 1), perform binary search to pinpoint the first occurrence of 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Inputs\n",
    "- **Array**: An infinite (or conceptually unbounded) sorted binary array (e.g., `[0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, ...]`).\n",
    "- **Assumption**: The array contains at least one occurrence of 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Outputs\n",
    "- An **integer** representing the index of the first occurrence of 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Detailed Example\n",
    "\n",
    "**Sample Input**:\n",
    "```plaintext\n",
    "Array (simulated finite segment): [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, ...]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Sample Output**:\n",
    "```plaintext\n",
    "Index: 4\n",

    "## 2. Identification\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Use Exponential Range Expansion + Modified Binary Search?\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Unknown Array Size**:\n",
    "   - Since the array is infinite (or its size is unknown), we cannot apply binary search directly. We first need to find a range where the target (first 1) exists.\n",
    "  \n",
    "2. **Sorted Binary Property**:\n",
    "   - The array is sorted such that all 0's come before all 1's. This guarantees that once you find a 1, every subsequent element is 1, and the first 1 is the boundary between the 0’s and 1’s.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Efficiency**:\n",
    "   - Exponential expansion quickly finds a window where the first 1 might be located in O(log p) time (where p is the position of the first 1). Then, binary search pinpoints the exact index in O(log p) time.\n",

    "## 3. Break Down → Two-Phase Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step-by-Step Sub-Tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Phase 1: Range Expansion**\n",
    "   - **Initialization**:  \n",
    "     Set `low = 0` and `high = 1`.\n",
    "   - **Expand Exponentially**:  \n",
    "     While `array[high]` is 0, update:\n",
    "     - `low = high`\n",
    "     - `high = high * 2`  \n",
    "     This ensures that eventually, `array[high]` becomes 1, and the first 1 lies between `low` and `high`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Phase 2: Modified Binary Search**\n",
    "   - **Search within [low, high]**:  \n",
    "     Perform a binary search with the following modification:\n",
    "     - Compute `mid = low + (high - low) / 2`.\n",
    "     - If `array[mid]` is 1 and either `mid` is 0 or `array[mid-1]` is 0, then `mid` is the index of the first 1.\n",
    "     - If `array[mid]` is 0, move right (`low = mid + 1`).\n",
    "     - Otherwise, move left (`high = mid - 1`).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Return Result**:\n",
    "   - Once the binary search completes, the index where the first 1 occurs is returned.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Explanations + Code\n",
    "\n",
    "### Detailed Explanation\n",
    "- **Range Expansion**:\n",
    "  - Starting with a small window, double the `high` index until you find an index where `array[high]` equals 1. This step quickly locates a window that contains the first 1.\n",
    "- **Modified Binary Search**:\n",
    "  - With the target window determined, perform binary search to find the exact position where the first 1 occurs. By checking the condition `if (array[mid] == 1 && (mid == 0 || array[mid-1] == 0))`, you ensure that the element is the first occurrence of 1.\n",
    "- **Time Complexity**:\n",
    "  - The exponential expansion takes O(log p) and the binary search within the window takes O(log p), where p is the position of the first 1.\n",
