    "# Searching in a Nearly Sorted Array Handout\n",
    "\n",
    "This handout explains how to search for a target element in a nearly sorted array. In a nearly sorted array, every element is at most one position away from its correct sorted position. We adapt binary search to account for this by checking the neighbors of the midpoint.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. IP–OP–PS (Input, Output, Problem Statement)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem Statement\n",
    "Given a **nearly sorted array**—an array in which every element may be misplaced by at most one position from its correct sorted order—and a target value, determine the index of the target element. If the target is not found, return `-1`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Operations**:\n",
    "- **Check** the middle element along with its immediate neighbors.\n",
    "- **Adjust** the search bounds by skipping two indices at a time, since the potential displacement is limited.\n",
    "- **Return** the index of the target if it is found; otherwise, return `-1`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Inputs\n",
    "- **Array**: A nearly sorted list of integers.\n",
    "- **Target**: The value to be searched for in the array.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Outputs\n",
    "- An **integer** representing the index of the target element if found.\n",
    "- `-1` if the target element is not present in the array.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Detailed Example\n",
    "\n",
    "**Sample Input**:\n",
    "```plaintext\n",
    "Array: [10, 3, 40, 20, 50, 80, 70]\n",
    "Target: 40\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Sample Output**:\n",
    "```plaintext\n",
    "Index: 2\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "*Explanation*:  \n",
    "Although the array is nearly sorted, the element `40` appears at index `2` (0-based indexing) and can be found by checking the mid element and its neighbors during the search.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Identification\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Use Modified Binary Search?\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Nearly Sorted Property**:  \n",
    "   - In a nearly sorted array, an element might be displaced by at most one position. Therefore, a normal binary search might miss the target if it lies next to the midpoint. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Efficiency**:  \n",
    "   - The modified binary search still operates in **O(log n)** time by effectively narrowing the search space while also checking the neighbors.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Key Cues**:  \n",
    "   - The array is \"almost sorted,\" suggesting that most properties of binary search hold.\n",
    "   - The displacement is limited (at most one position), prompting the need to check `mid-1` and `mid+1` in addition to `mid`.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Break Down → Modified Binary Search Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step-by-Step Sub-Tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initialization**:\n",
    "   - Set two pointers: `low = 0` and `high = n - 1` (where `n` is the length of the array).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Iterative Process**:\n",
    "   - **Calculate Midpoint**:  \n",
    "     - Compute `mid = low + (high - low) / 2`.\n",
    "   - **Check for Target**:\n",
    "     - If `array[mid]` is equal to the target, return `mid`.\n",
    "     - Otherwise, check if the target is present at `mid - 1` or `mid + 1` (ensuring the indices are within bounds).\n",
    "   - **Adjust Search Boundaries**:\n",
    "     - If the target is greater than `array[mid]`, move the search to the right by setting `low = mid + 2` (since `mid+1` has been checked).\n",
    "     - Otherwise, move to the left by setting `high = mid - 2`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Termination**:\n",
    "   - If the search space is exhausted (i.e., `low > high`), return `-1` indicating the target is not found.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Data Structures Used**:\n",
    "   - The algorithm operates on an **array**.\n",
    "   - Uses simple index pointers (`low`, `mid`, `high`) for navigation.\n",

    "## 4. Explanations + Code\n",
    "\n",
    "### Detailed Explanation\n",
    "- **Initialization**:  \n",
    "  Begin with the full array range.\n",
    "- **Mid Calculation & Neighbor Check**:  \n",
    "  In addition to checking `array[mid]`, we check `array[mid-1]` and `array[mid+1]` (if they exist) because the array is nearly sorted.\n",
    "- **Adjusting Pointers**:  \n",
    "  If the target is greater than `array[mid]`, we can safely ignore the left part up to `mid+1` and vice versa.\n",
    "- **Time Complexity**:  \n",
    "  The modified approach maintains an overall time complexity of **O(log n)**.\n",
