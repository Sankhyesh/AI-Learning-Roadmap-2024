    "# Search an Element in a Bitonic Array Handout\n",
    "\n",
    "A **bitonic array** is an array that first increases to a maximum (the peak) and then decreases. To search for a target element in such an array, you can leverage its structure by first finding the peak and then performing two binary searches—one in the increasing part and one in the decreasing part.\n",

    "## 1. IP–OP–PS (Input, Output, Problem Statement)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem Statement\n",
    "Given a **bitonic array** of distinct integers and a target value, determine the index of the target element.  \n",
    "Since the array is bitonic, it is first strictly increasing, reaches a maximum element (peak), and then strictly decreases.  \n",
    "The goal is to efficiently search for the target element by utilizing this structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Operations**:\n",
    "- **Find the Peak**: Determine the index of the maximum element in the array.\n",
    "- **Binary Search in Ascending Part**: Search the increasing portion (from start to peak) for the target.\n",
    "- **Binary Search in Descending Part**: If not found, search the decreasing portion (from peak + 1 to end) for the target.\n",
    "- **Return** the index of the target element or `-1` if not found.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Inputs\n",
    "- **Array**: A bitonic array of integers (e.g., `[1, 3, 8, 12, 4, 2]`).\n",
    "- **Target**: An integer value (e.g., `4`).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Outputs\n",
    "- An **integer** representing the index of the target element if found; otherwise, `-1`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Detailed Example\n",
    "\n",
    "**Sample Input**:\n",
    "```plaintext\n",
    "Array: [1, 3, 8, 12, 4, 2]\n",
    "Target: 4\n",
    "```\n",

    "## 2. Identification\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Use a Two-Phase Approach?\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Bitonic Structure**:\n",
    "   - The array is divided into two sorted segments: an increasing sequence followed by a decreasing sequence.  \n",
    "   - Knowing the peak helps split the problem into two standard binary search tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Efficiency**:\n",
    "   - Instead of scanning the entire array (O(n) time), we can find the peak and then perform two binary searches (each O(log n)), resulting in an overall O(log n) solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Key Cues**:\n",
    "   - The array is first increasing and then decreasing.\n",
    "   - Finding the peak is a well-known sub-problem that can be solved with modified binary search.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Break Down → Two-Phase Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step-by-Step Sub-Tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Phase 1: Find the Peak Element**\n",
    "   - **Binary Search for Peak**:\n",
    "     - Initialize `low = 0` and `high = n - 1`.\n",
    "     - While `low < high`, compute `mid = low + (high - low) / 2`.\n",
    "     - If `arr[mid] < arr[mid + 1]`, then the peak is to the right; set `low = mid + 1`.\n",
    "     - Otherwise, set `high = mid`.\n",
    "     - After the loop, `low` (or `high`) is the peak index.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Phase 2: Search for the Target**\n",
    "   - **Search in the Ascending Part**:\n",
    "     - Perform a standard binary search between indices `0` and `peak` (inclusive).\n",
    "   - **Search in the Descending Part**:\n",
    "     - If the target is not found in the increasing part, perform a modified binary search (for descending order) between indices `peak + 1` and `n - 1`.\n",
    "     - In descending order, reverse the comparison: if `arr[mid] < target`, search the left half; otherwise, search the right half.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Return the Result**:\n",
    "   - Return the index if the target is found in either part.\n",
    "   - If not found in both, return `-1`.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Explanations + Code\n",
    "\n",
    "### Detailed Explanation\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Finding the Peak**:\n",
    "  - The peak is the highest element where the sequence transitions from increasing to decreasing. Using binary search here is efficient because if `arr[mid] < arr[mid + 1]`, the peak must lie to the right; otherwise, it lies to the left (or at `mid`).\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Binary Search in Ascending Part**:\n",
    "  - This is a standard binary search since the subarray is sorted in ascending order.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Binary Search in Descending Part**:\n",
    "  - In a descending subarray, the binary search condition is inverted. For example, if the target is greater than `arr[mid]`, then the target must lie in the left half.\n",
