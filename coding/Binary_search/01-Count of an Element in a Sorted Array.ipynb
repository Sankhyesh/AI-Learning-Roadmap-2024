    "# Count of an Element in a Sorted Array Handout\n",
    "\n",
    "This handout explains how to count the occurrences of a given target in a sorted array using a modified binary search. The approach uses two binary searches—one to find the first (lower bound) and another to find the last (upper bound) occurrence of the target—and then calculates the count.\n",

    "## 1. IP–OP–PS (Input, Output, Problem Statement)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem Statement\n",
    "Given a **sorted array** and a target value, determine the number of times the target occurs in the array.  \n",
    "The key idea is to use binary search to efficiently find the boundaries (first and last positions) of the target element in the array.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Operations**:\n",
    "- **Locate** the first occurrence (lower bound) of the target.\n",
    "- **Locate** the last occurrence (upper bound) of the target.\n",
    "- **Compute** the count as `(last_index - first_index + 1)` if the target exists; otherwise, return `0`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Inputs\n",
    "- **Array**: A sorted list of integers (or any comparable items).\n",
    "- **Target**: The value whose occurrences need to be counted.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Outputs\n",
    "- An **integer** representing the number of times the target appears in the array.\n",

    "**Sample Input**:\n",
    "```plaintext\n",
    "Array: [1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n",

    "### Why Use Modified Binary Search?\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Sorted Array**:  \n",
    "   - The precondition of a sorted array enables us to efficiently narrow down the search space.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Efficiency**:  \n",
    "   - A standard linear scan takes O(n) time, but using two binary searches reduces the time complexity to O(log n).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Key Cues**:  \n",
    "   - The task involves counting occurrences in a sorted structure.\n",
    "   - Finding boundaries (first and last occurrences) directly hints at using modified binary search.\n",

    "### Step-by-Step Sub-Tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Find the Lower Bound (First Occurrence)**:\n",
    "   - **Initialize**: Set `low = 0` and `high = n - 1`.\n",
    "   - **Loop**: While `low <= high`, compute `mid = low + (high - low) / 2`.\n",
    "   - **Update**:\n",
    "     - If `array[mid]` is **greater than or equal** to the target, move left (`high = mid - 1`).\n",
    "     - Otherwise, move right (`low = mid + 1`).\n",
    "   - **Result**: The index pointed to by `low` is the first occurrence if `array[low] == target`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Find the Upper Bound (Last Occurrence)**:\n",
    "   - **Initialize**: Reset `low = 0` and `high = n - 1`.\n",
    "   - **Loop**: While `low <= high`, compute `mid = low + (high - low) / 2`.\n",
    "   - **Update**:\n",
    "     - If `array[mid]` is **less than or equal** to the target, move right (`low = mid + 1`).\n",
    "     - Otherwise, move left (`high = mid - 1`).\n",
    "   - **Result**: The index pointed to by `high` is the last occurrence if `array[high] == target`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Calculate the Count**:\n",
    "   - If the target is present (verified by checking `array[first_occurrence]`), the **count** is given by:  \n",
    "     `count = (last_occurrence - first_occurrence + 1)`.\n",
    "   - Otherwise, return `0`.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Data Structures Used**:\n",
    "   - The algorithm operates on an **array**.\n",
    "   - Uses simple pointer/indices (`low`, `mid`, `high`) to navigate the array.\n",

    "## 4. Explanations + Code\n",
    "\n",
    "### Detailed Explanation\n",
    "1. **Lower Bound Search**:\n",
    "   - This search finds the first position where the target appears.\n",
    "   - By moving the `high` pointer when `array[mid]` is at least the target, we narrow the search toward the leftmost occurrence.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Upper Bound Search**:\n",
    "   - This search finds the last position where the target appears.\n",
    "   - By moving the `low` pointer when `array[mid]` is less than or equal to the target, we shift the search toward the rightmost occurrence.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Time Complexity**:\n",
    "   - Each binary search takes O(log n) time.\n",
    "   - The overall solution runs in O(log n) time.\n",
