    "# Peak Element Handout\n",
    "\n",
    "A **peak element** in an array is defined as an element that is not smaller than its neighbors. For corner elements, we consider only one neighbor. The problem is to find any one peak element in the array. Note that there may be multiple peak elements, and any valid peak can be returned.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. IP–OP–PS (Input, Output, Problem Statement)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem Statement\n",
    "Given an unsorted array of integers, find a peak element. An element is considered a peak if it is not smaller than its neighbors. For the first and last elements, we consider only one neighbor.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Operations**:\n",
    "- **Identify** if an element is a peak by comparing it with its neighbors.\n",
    "- **Return** the index of any one peak element.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Inputs\n",
    "- **Array**: An unsorted list of integers (e.g., `[1, 3, 20, 4, 1, 0]`).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Outputs\n",
    "- **Index**: An integer representing the index of a peak element.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Detailed Example\n",
    "\n",
    "**Sample Input**:\n",
    "```plaintext\n",
    "Array: [1, 3, 20, 4, 1, 0]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Sample Output**:\n",
    "```plaintext\n",
    "Index: 2\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "*Explanation*:  \n",
    "The element at index 2 is 20, which is greater than its neighbors (3 and 4), so it is a peak element. Note that other peaks may exist, and returning any one of them is acceptable.\n",

    "## 2. Identification\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Use Binary Search?\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Divide and Conquer**:\n",
    "   - Although the array is unsorted, the peak finding property allows us to use binary search by comparing an element with its neighbors to decide which side must contain a peak.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Efficiency**:\n",
    "   - A linear scan would require O(n) time, but binary search narrows down the search space in O(log n) time, making it highly efficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Guaranteed Existence**:\n",
    "   - It is mathematically guaranteed that an array has at least one peak element. This ensures the binary search approach will always find a solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Break Down → Modified Binary Search Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step-by-Step Sub-Tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initialization**:\n",
    "   - Set two pointers: `low = 0` and `high = n - 1` where `n` is the length of the array.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Iterative Process**:\n",
    "   - **Calculate Midpoint**:  \n",
    "     Compute `mid = low + (high - low) / 2`.\n",
    "   - **Check for Peak**:\n",
    "     - If the element at `mid` is greater than or equal to its neighbors (considering edge conditions), then `mid` is a peak.\n",
    "   - **Decision Making**:\n",
    "     - If the left neighbor of `mid` is greater than `mid`, then a peak must exist on the left side; update `high = mid - 1`.\n",
    "     - Otherwise, if the right neighbor is greater than `mid`, a peak exists on the right side; update `low = mid + 1`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Termination**:\n",
    "   - The loop terminates when a peak is found. Since at least one peak exists, the algorithm will eventually return a valid index.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Data Structures Used**:\n",
    "   - The algorithm uses the input **array** and two integer pointers (`low` and `high`) for navigation.\n",

    "---\n",

    "## 4. Explanations + Code\n",

    "### Detailed Explanation\n",
    "- **Initialization**:  \n",
    "  Start with the entire array using `low` and `high` pointers.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Mid Calculation & Comparison**:  \n",
    "  Calculate the mid index and compare `array[mid]` with its neighbors. For edge cases (first and last elements), only one neighbor is compared.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Pointer Adjustment**:  \n",
    "  If the left neighbor is larger, move left (since a peak must exist in that half). Otherwise, move right.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Time Complexity**:  \n",
    "  Each step halves the search space, resulting in an O(log n) solution.\n",
