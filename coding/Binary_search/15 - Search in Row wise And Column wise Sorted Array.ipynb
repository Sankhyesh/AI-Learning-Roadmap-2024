    "# Search in a Row-wise and Column-wise Sorted Array Handout\n",
    "\n",
    "A **row-wise and column-wise sorted matrix** is one in which every row is sorted in increasing order (from left to right) and every column is sorted in increasing order (from top to bottom). The goal of this problem is to efficiently search for a target value within such a matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. IP–OP–PS (Input, Output, Problem Statement)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem Statement\n",
    "Given a matrix where each row and each column is sorted in increasing order, determine if a target element exists in the matrix, and if so, return its position (row and column indices). If the target is not found, indicate that as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Operations**:\n",
    "- **Traverse** the matrix using its sorted properties.\n",
    "- **Eliminate** rows or columns based on comparisons with the target.\n",
    "- **Return** the (row, column) position of the target if found, or an indication (e.g., `(-1, -1)`) if not found.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Inputs\n",
    "- **Matrix**: A two-dimensional array (matrix) of integers that is sorted row-wise and column-wise.  \n",
    "  Example:\n",
    "  ```plaintext\n",
    "  [\n",
    "    [1,  4,  7, 11],\n",
    "    [2,  5,  8, 12],\n",
    "    [3,  6,  9, 16],\n",
    "    [10, 13, 14, 17]\n",
    "  ]\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "- **Target**: An integer value (e.g., `5`).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Outputs\n",
    "- A **tuple** `(row, col)` representing the indices of the target element if it exists; otherwise, a special value such as `(-1, -1)` indicating that the target is not present.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Detailed Example\n",
    "\n",
    "**Sample Input**:\n",
    "```plaintext\n",
    "Matrix:\n",
    "[\n",
    "  [1,  4,  7, 11],\n",
    "  [2,  5,  8, 12],\n",
    "  [3,  6,  9, 16],\n",
    "  [10, 13, 14, 17]\n",

    "Position: (1, 1)\n",
    "```\n",

    "*Explanation*:  \n",
    "The target `5` is located at row index 1 and column index 1 (using 0-based indexing).\n",

    "## 2. Identification\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Use a Specialized Approach?\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Sorted Matrix Properties**:\n",
    "   - Every row is sorted in increasing order.\n",
    "   - Every column is sorted in increasing order.\n",
    "   - These properties allow us to eliminate portions of the matrix without examining every element.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Efficiency**:\n",
    "   - A naive approach would check every element in O(n*m) time.\n",
    "   - By leveraging the sorted order, we can design an algorithm that runs in O(n + m) time.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Key Cues**:\n",
    "   - The matrix’s sorted order along rows and columns enables a \"staircase\" or \"step-wise\" search.  \n",
    "   - Starting from the top-right corner (or bottom-left) allows us to move in one direction to eliminate either an entire row or an entire column based on comparisons with the target.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Break Down → Step-by-Step Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step-by-Step Sub-Tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initialization**:\n",
    "   - Start at the **top-right corner** of the matrix.  \n",
    "     Let `row = 0` and `col = m - 1` (where `m` is the number of columns).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Iterative Process**:\n",
    "   - **Compare** the current element (`matrix[row][col]`) with the target.\n",
    "     - **If Equal**:  \n",
    "       Return the position `(row, col)`.\n",
    "     - **If Greater**:  \n",
    "       The current element is larger than the target, so all elements in the current column below are also larger.  \n",
    "       **Action**: Move **left** by decrementing `col`.\n",
    "     - **If Less**:  \n",
    "       The current element is smaller than the target, so all elements in the current row to the left are also smaller.  \n",
    "       **Action**: Move **down** by incrementing `row`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Termination**:\n",
    "   - Continue the process until you either find the target or the indices go out of bounds (i.e., `row` equals the number of rows or `col` becomes negative).\n",
    "   - If out of bounds, return `(-1, -1)` to indicate that the target is not present.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Explanations + Code\n",
    "\n",
    "### Detailed Explanation\n",
    "- **Starting Point**:  \n",
    "  The top-right corner is chosen because it gives the best opportunity to eliminate a row or column with each comparison.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Decision Making**:\n",
    "  - If the current element is greater than the target, then the target cannot be in the current column (as all elements below are even larger), so move left.\n",
    "  - If the current element is less than the target, then the target cannot be in the current row (as all elements to the left are smaller), so move down.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Time Complexity**:  \n",
    "  In the worst case, you might traverse all rows or all columns once, resulting in a time complexity of O(n + m).\n",
