    "# Allocate Minimum Number Of Pages Handout\n",
    "\n",
    "In this problem, you are given an array where each element represents the number of pages in a book and a number of students. You must assign books to the students (keeping the order of the books intact) such that each student gets at least one book and the maximum number of pages allocated to any student is minimized.\n",

    "### Problem Statement\n",
    "Given an array of integers (each integer representing the number of pages in a book) and an integer representing the number of students, determine the minimum possible value of the maximum number of pages assigned to a student. Books must be allocated in contiguous order.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Operations**:\n",
    "- **Contiguous Allocation**: Books must be assigned in the order given.\n",
    "- **Minimize Maximum**: Among all possible valid allocations, choose the one where the maximum pages any student gets is minimized.\n",
    "- **Return the Value**: If allocation is impossible (e.g., when the number of books is less than the number of students), return `-1`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Inputs\n",
    "- **Array of Pages**: A list of positive integers, e.g., `[12, 34, 67, 90]`.\n",
    "- **Number of Students**: A positive integer, e.g., `2`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Outputs\n",
    "- **Minimum Maximum Pages**: A single integer representing the minimized maximum pages allocated to a student (e.g., `113`).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Detailed Example\n",
    "\n",
    "**Sample Input**:\n",
    "```plaintext\n",
    "Books: [12, 34, 67, 90]\n",
    "Students: 2\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Sample Output**:\n",
    "```plaintext\n",
    "Minimum Maximum Pages: 113\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "*Explanation*:  \n",
    "One optimal allocation is:\n",
    "- Student 1: Books `[12, 34, 67]` → Total pages = 113  \n",
    "- Student 2: Book `[90]` → Total pages = 90  \n",
    "Here, the maximum pages assigned is 113, which is minimized among all valid allocations.\n",

    "## 2. Identification\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Use Binary Search on Answer?\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Ordered Answer Range**:\n",
    "   - The answer (i.e., the maximum pages a student gets) lies between the maximum number of pages in a single book (as no student can be allocated less than that) and the sum of all pages (if one student gets all books).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Efficiency**:\n",
    "   - A brute-force approach would check all possible allocations, which is exponential. Instead, we can binary search on the range of possible answers (from `max(pages)` to `sum(pages)`) to efficiently find the minimum feasible maximum.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Feasibility Predicate**:\n",
    "   - For any candidate maximum value, we can check if it’s possible to allocate books to all students such that no student receives more than that candidate value using a greedy approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Break Down → Two-Phase Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step-by-Step Sub-Tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Define the Search Space**:\n",
    "   - **Lower Bound**: The maximum number of pages in a single book (since each student must take at least one book).\n",
    "   - **Upper Bound**: The total sum of pages (if one student gets all the books).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Feasibility Function (Predicate)**:\n",
    "   - Given a candidate value `mid`, simulate the allocation:\n",
    "     - Iterate over the books, summing pages until adding another book would exceed `mid`.\n",
    "     - Allocate the accumulated books to a student and start a new sum.\n",
    "     - Count the number of students needed.\n",
    "   - If the number of students required is less than or equal to the given number, then the allocation is feasible.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Binary Search on Answer**:\n",
    "   - While the lower bound is less than or equal to the upper bound:\n",
    "     - Compute `mid = low + (high - low) / 2`.\n",
    "     - If the allocation is feasible with `mid` as the maximum allowed pages, try to find a smaller value by setting `high = mid - 1`.\n",
    "     - Otherwise, set `low = mid + 1`.\n",
    "   - The optimal answer will be the smallest candidate for which the allocation is feasible.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Return the Answer**:\n",
    "   - After the binary search completes, the lower bound (`low`) will be the minimum maximum pages possible.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Detailed Explanation\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Search Space Initialization**:\n",
    "  - `low` is set to the maximum pages in any single book.\n",
    "  - `high` is set to the sum of all pages.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Feasibility Check**:\n",
    "  - For a candidate maximum `mid`, iterate through the books and keep a running total. If adding the next book exceeds `mid`, assign the current set of books to one student and reset the total. Count how many students are needed.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Binary Search**:\n",
    "  - Adjust the bounds based on the feasibility check until the minimal possible maximum is found.\n",
