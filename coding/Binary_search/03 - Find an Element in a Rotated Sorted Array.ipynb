    "# Find an Element in a Rotated Sorted Array Handout\n",
    "\n",
    "This handout explains how to efficiently search for a target element in a rotated sorted array using a modified binary search. The algorithm leverages the sorted nature of the array—even though it has been rotated—to maintain a logarithmic time complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. IP–OP–PS (Input, Output, Problem Statement)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem Statement\n",
    "Given a **rotated sorted array** (an array that was originally sorted in ascending order and then rotated a number of times) and a target value, determine whether the target exists in the array and return its index. If the target is not found, return `-1`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Operations**:\n",
    "- **Identify** which part of the array is sorted.\n",
    "- **Decide** which subarray to search based on the target's value.\n",
    "- **Return** the index of the target if found, or `-1` if not.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Inputs\n",
    "- **Array**: A rotated sorted list of integers.\n",
    "- **Target**: The value to search for in the array.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Outputs\n",
    "- An **integer** representing the index of the target element if found.\n",
    "- `-1` if the target element is not present in the array.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Detailed Example\n",
    "\n",
    "**Sample Input**:\n",
    "```plaintext\n",
    "Array: [6, 7, 8, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n",
    "Target: 3\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Sample Output**:\n",
    "```plaintext\n",
    "Index: 5\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "*Explanation*:  \n",
    "The original sorted array would have been `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]`. After rotation, the array becomes `[6, 7, 8, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, and the target `3` is found at index `5` (using 0-based indexing).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Identification\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Use Modified Binary Search?\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Rotated Sorted Structure**:  \n",
    "   - Although the array is rotated, it still comprises two sorted subarrays. This structure enables a modified binary search to be effective.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Efficiency**:  \n",
    "   - A linear scan would require O(n) time, but by adapting binary search, we can achieve O(log n) time complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Key Cues**:  \n",
    "   - The array is mostly sorted except for a single pivot point.\n",
    "   - The problem statement hints at using binary search even in a rotated scenario by comparing mid values with boundary elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Break Down → Modified Binary Search Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step-by-Step Sub-Tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initialization**:\n",
    "   - Set two pointers: `low = 0` and `high = n - 1`, where `n` is the length of the array.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Iterative Process**:\n",
    "   - **Compute Midpoint**:  \n",
    "     - Calculate `mid = low + (high - low) / 2` to avoid potential overflow.\n",
    "   - **Check for Target**:\n",
    "     - If `array[mid]` equals the target, return `mid`.\n",
    "   - **Determine Sorted Portion**:\n",
    "     - **Left Sorted Portion**:  \n",
    "       - If `array[low] <= array[mid]`, then the left half is sorted.\n",
    "       - Check if the target lies between `array[low]` and `array[mid]`. If yes, set `high = mid - 1`; otherwise, set `low = mid + 1`.\n",
    "     - **Right Sorted Portion**:  \n",
    "       - Else, the right half must be sorted.\n",
    "       - Check if the target lies between `array[mid]` and `array[high]`. If yes, set `low = mid + 1`; otherwise, set `high = mid - 1`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Termination**:\n",
    "   - If the search space is exhausted (`low > high`), return `-1` indicating the target is not found.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Data Structures Used**:\n",
    "   - The algorithm operates on an **array**.\n",
    "   - It uses simple indices (`low`, `mid`, `high`) to narrow the search space.\n",

    "### Detailed Explanation\n",
    "- **Initialization**:  \n",
    "  Start with the entire array range.\n",
    "- **Mid Calculation & Target Check**:  \n",
    "  Calculate the middle index; if the element at `mid` equals the target, you have found the answer.\n",
    "- **Determining the Sorted Half**:\n",
    "  - **Left Half Sorted**: If the left part of the array is sorted and the target lies within its boundaries, adjust the `high` pointer.\n",
    "  - **Right Half Sorted**: Otherwise, if the right part is sorted and contains the target, adjust the `low` pointer.\n",
    "- **Time Complexity**:  \n",
    "  The algorithm runs in O(log n) time since it halves the search space with each iteration.\n",
