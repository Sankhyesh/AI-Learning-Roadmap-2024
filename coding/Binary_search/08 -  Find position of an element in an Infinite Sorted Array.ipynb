    "# Find Position of an Element in an Infinite Sorted Array Handout\n",
    "\n",
    "This handout explains how to locate a target element in an infinite (or conceptually unbounded) sorted array. Since the size of the array is unknown (or infinite), the strategy is to first find a range where the target may reside by expanding the window exponentially, and then perform a binary search within that range.\n",

    "## 1. IP–OP–PS (Input, Output, Problem Statement)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem Statement\n",
    "Given an **infinite sorted array** (or an array whose length is not known) and a target value, find the position (index) of the target element. Because the array is infinite, you cannot use the standard binary search directly since you do not know the bounds. Instead, you must first determine a finite window (range) that contains the target and then apply binary search on that window.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Operations**:\n",
    "- **Range Expansion**: Start with a small range and expand exponentially until the end of the range is greater than or equal to the target.\n",
    "- **Binary Search**: Once the range is determined, apply binary search to find the target's position.\n",
    "- **Return** the index of the target element or `-1` if the element is not found.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Inputs\n",
    "- **Array**: An infinite (or unbounded) sorted list of integers.\n",
    "- **Target**: The value to be searched for in the array.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Outputs\n",
    "- An **integer** representing the index of the target element if found.\n",
    "- `-1` if the target element is not found.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Detailed Example\n",
    "\n",
    "**Sample Input**:\n",
    "```plaintext\n",
    "Infinite Sorted Array (simulated): [3, 5, 7, 9, 10, 90, 120, 130, 140, ...]\n",
    "Target: 10\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Sample Output**:\n",
    "```plaintext\n",
    "Index: 4\n",
    "```\n",

    "*Explanation*:  \n",
    "Even though the array is infinite, we first expand our search window until an element ≥ 10 is found. Then, we perform a binary search within that window. Here, the target `10` is found at index `4`.\n",

    "## 2. Identification\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Use the Exponential Range Expansion + Binary Search Approach?\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Unknown Array Size**:\n",
    "   - In an infinite array, you cannot directly access the last index; hence, a conventional binary search (which requires known boundaries) is not applicable.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Efficiency**:\n",
    "   - Exponentially expanding the range until the target is less than or equal to the element at the high index allows you to quickly narrow down a finite search space.\n",
    "   - Binary search within that finite window then locates the target in O(log n) time.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Key Cues**:\n",
    "   - The array is sorted but unbounded, suggesting the need for a two-phase approach: first find a valid search interval, then apply binary search.\n",

    "## 3. Break Down → Two-Phase Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step-by-Step Sub-Tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Phase 1: Range Expansion**:\n",
    "   - **Initialization**:  \n",
    "     Set a starting index (e.g., `low = 0`) and an initial high index (e.g., `high = 1`).\n",
    "   - **Exponential Expansion**:  \n",
    "     While the element at the `high` index is less than the target, update:\n",
    "     - `low = high`\n",
    "     - `high = high * 2`\n",
    "   - After this loop, the target lies between `low` and `high`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Phase 2: Binary Search in the Determined Range**:\n",
    "   - **Initialization**:  \n",
    "     Use the range `[low, high]` found in Phase 1.\n",
    "   - **Standard Binary Search**:\n",
    "     - Compute the midpoint `mid = low + (high - low) / 2`.\n",
    "     - If `array[mid]` equals the target, return `mid`.\n",
    "     - If `array[mid]` is greater than the target, move `high` to `mid - 1`.\n",
    "     - Otherwise, move `low` to `mid + 1`.\n",
    "   - Continue until `low` exceeds `high`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Data Structures Used**:\n",
    "   - The algorithm uses a simple array.\n",
    "   - Two pointers (`low` and `high`) for the exponential search and binary search phases.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Explanations + Code\n",
    "\n",
    "### Detailed Explanation\n",
    "- **Range Expansion**:\n",
    "  - Starting with a small window, the algorithm expands the search boundary exponentially (e.g., doubling the `high` index) until it finds a value that is not less than the target.\n",
    "  - This phase ensures that the target, if present, is within the window `[low, high]`.\n",
    "- **Binary Search**:\n",
    "  - With the target guaranteed to lie within the window, a standard binary search is applied.\n",
    "  - The binary search quickly converges to the target in O(log n) time within that window.\n",
    "- **Time Complexity**:\n",
    "  - The range expansion phase takes O(log p) time where p is the position of the target.\n",
    "  - The binary search phase then takes O(log p) time, yielding an overall time complexity of O(log p).\n",
