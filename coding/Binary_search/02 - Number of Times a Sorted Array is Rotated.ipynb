    "# Number of Times a Sorted Array is Rotated Handout\n",
    "\n",
    "This handout explains how to determine the number of times a sorted array has been rotated. The idea is to identify the pivot point (i.e., the smallest element) in the rotated sorted array using a modified binary search. The index of this smallest element directly corresponds to the number of rotations.\n",

    "## 1. IP–OP–PS (Input, Output, Problem Statement)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem Statement\n",
    "Given a **rotated sorted array** (an array originally sorted in ascending order that has been rotated a number of times), determine the number of times the array has been rotated.  \n",
    "This is equivalent to finding the index of the smallest element in the array.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Operations**:\n",
    "- **Identify** the pivot (smallest element) using binary search.\n",
    "- **Return** the index of the pivot as the rotation count.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Inputs\n",
    "- **Array**: A rotated sorted list of integers.\n",
    "  \n",
    "### Outputs\n",
    "- An **integer** representing the number of rotations (i.e., the index of the smallest element).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Detailed Example\n",
    "\n",
    "**Sample Input**:\n",
    "```plaintext\n",
    "Array: [15, 18, 2, 3, 6, 12]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Sample Output**:\n",
    "```plaintext\n",
    "Rotation Count: 2\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "*Explanation*:  \n",
    "The sorted array before rotation would be `[2, 3, 6, 12, 15, 18]`. The array has been rotated 2 times since the smallest element `2` is at index `2`.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Identification\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Use Modified Binary Search?\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Sorted Structure with Rotation**:  \n",
    "   - The array is originally sorted, but rotated. This special structure allows us to use a modified binary search to find the pivot (smallest element) efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Efficiency**:  \n",
    "   - Instead of a linear scan (O(n)), the modified binary search finds the pivot in **O(log n)** time, making it suitable for large arrays.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Key Cues**:  \n",
    "   - A rotated sorted array typically shows a break point where the order is disrupted (i.e., a drop from a high value to a lower value). This is the signature for using binary search to identify the pivot.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Break Down → Modified Binary Search Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step-by-Step Sub-Tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initial Check**:\n",
    "   - **If** the array’s first element is less than or equal to its last element, the array is not rotated. Return `0`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Binary Search Initialization**:\n",
    "   - Set `low = 0` and `high = n - 1` (where `n` is the array length).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Iterative Process**:\n",
    "   - While `low <= high`, compute `mid = low + (high - low) / 2`.\n",
    "   - Determine the neighboring indices in a circular fashion:\n",
    "     - `next = (mid + 1) % n`\n",
    "     - `prev = (mid - 1 + n) % n`\n",
    "   - **Check Pivot Condition**:\n",
    "     - If `array[mid]` is less than or equal to both `array[next]` and `array[prev]`, then `array[mid]` is the minimum element. Return `mid` as the rotation count.\n",
    "   - **Decide Which Side to Search**:\n",
    "     - If `array[mid] >= array[low]`, then the left portion is sorted and the pivot must lie in the right half. Update `low = mid + 1`.\n",
    "     - Otherwise, update `high = mid - 1`.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Result**:\n",
    "   - The algorithm eventually returns the index of the smallest element, which represents the number of rotations.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data Structures Used**:\n",
    "- A simple **array**.\n",
    "- Variables (`low`, `mid`, `high`) to maintain the search boundaries.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Explanations + Code\n",
    "\n",
    "### Detailed Explanation\n",
    "- **Initial Check**:  \n",
    "  If the first element is smaller than or equal to the last element, the array is fully sorted with no rotations.\n",
    "- **Binary Search Loop**:  \n",
    "  Repeatedly calculate the middle index and check if it satisfies the pivot condition (i.e., being less than or equal to its neighbors).\n",
    "- **Pivot Condition**:  \n",
    "  When the pivot is found, its index directly indicates the number of rotations.\n",
    "- **Time Complexity**:  \n",
    "  Each iteration halves the search space, resulting in **O(log n)** time.\n",
