    "# Binary Search on Answer Concept Handout\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. IP–OP–PS (Input, Output, Problem Statement)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem Statement\n",
    "Many problems ask for an optimal value (such as the minimum cost, maximum size, or minimum time) that satisfies certain conditions. Directly computing this optimal value may be challenging. Instead, we can use the **Binary Search on Answer** technique:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Input**:  \n",
    "  - A sorted range of potential answer values (or a known lower and upper bound).\n",
    "  - A decision function (predicate) that, given a candidate answer, determines whether it is feasible (i.e., if the candidate meets the problem's constraints).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Output**:  \n",
    "  - The optimal answer (for example, the smallest value that satisfies the condition).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Problem Statement (Example)**:  \n",
    "  \"Given a set of tasks and a maximum allowed time, find the minimum speed required to complete all tasks on time.\"  \n",
    "  In this problem, speeds form a continuous (or discrete) range, and for any candidate speed, we can check if it is sufficient to finish the tasks within the given time.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Detailed Example\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we have:\n",
    "- A range of possible speeds [1, 100].\n",
    "- A function `isFeasible(speed)` that returns `True` if all tasks can be completed at that speed within the allowed time.\n",
    "- **Goal**: Find the minimum speed that makes `isFeasible(speed)` return `True`.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Identification\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Use Binary Search on Answer?\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Ordered Answer Range**:  \n",
    "   - The candidate answers can be ordered. If a candidate answer is feasible, then any higher value is also feasible (or vice versa, depending on the problem).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Efficiency**:  \n",
    "   - Instead of testing each possible value in the range, binary search reduces the number of candidate tests to O(log n), where n is the size of the search space.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Feasibility Predicate**:  \n",
    "   - Problems often provide a clear way to check if a candidate answer works (e.g., simulate tasks, compute cost, etc.), making it ideal for binary search.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Break Down → Two-Phase Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step-by-Step Sub-Tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Define the Search Space**:\n",
    "   - Identify the lower and upper bounds of possible answers (e.g., minimum and maximum speeds).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Implement the Feasibility Function**:\n",
    "   - Write a function `isFeasible(candidate)` that returns `True` if the candidate answer meets the required constraints, and `False` otherwise.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Apply Binary Search on the Answer**:\n",
    "   - Initialize `low` and `high` with the bounds.\n",
    "   - While `low` is less than or equal to `high`:\n",
    "     - Compute `mid = low + (high - low) // 2`.\n",
    "     - If `isFeasible(mid)` is `True`, then the candidate is valid; try to find a smaller valid answer by setting `high = mid - 1`.\n",
    "     - Otherwise, set `low = mid + 1`.\n",
    "   - When the loop terminates, `low` holds the optimal answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Return the Answer**:\n",
    "   - The answer is the minimum candidate for which the feasibility function is `True`.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Explanations + Code\n",
    "\n",
    "### Detailed Explanation\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Search Space Initialization**:  \n",
    "  Determine the range of possible answers. For example, if looking for a minimum speed, you might know the answer lies between `minSpeed` and `maxSpeed`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Feasibility Function**:  \n",
    "  This function encapsulates the decision problem. For instance, `isFeasible(speed)` may simulate tasks to check if they can be completed at the given speed.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Binary Search Loop**:\n",
    "  - Calculate the midpoint candidate.\n",
    "  - Use the feasibility function to decide whether to search in the lower or higher half of the range.\n",
    "  - The search stops when the optimal candidate is found.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Time Complexity**:  \n",
    "  The binary search on answer runs in O(log(range)) multiplied by the cost of the feasibility function.\n",
