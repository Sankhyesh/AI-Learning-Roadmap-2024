    "# Next Alphabetical Element Handout\n",
    "\n",
    "This handout explains how to find the next alphabetical element in a sorted, circular array of characters. In this problem, given a sorted array of letters and a target letter, the goal is to return the smallest letter that is strictly greater than the target. If no such letter exists (i.e., if the target is greater than or equal to all letters), the array is treated as circular and the first element is returned.\n",

    "## 1. IP–OP–PS (Input, Output, Problem Statement)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem Statement\n",
    "Given a **sorted array of characters** (letters) and a target character, determine the next alphabetical element that is greater than the target.  \n",
    "If the target is equal to or larger than the last element in the array, return the first element (circular property).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Operations**:\n",
    "- **Search** for the leftmost letter greater than the target.\n",
    "- **Handle Wrap-Around**: If no letter in the array is greater than the target, return the first element.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Inputs\n",
    "- **Array**: A sorted list of characters (e.g., `['c', 'f', 'j']`).\n",
    "- **Target**: A character (e.g., `'a'`).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Outputs\n",
    "- A **character** representing the next alphabetical element that is greater than the target.  \n",
    "- If the target is greater than or equal to all letters, return the first letter of the array.\n",

    "### Detailed Example\n",
    "\n",
    "**Sample Input**:\n",
    "```plaintext\n",
    "Letters: ['c', 'f', 'j']\n",
    "Target: 'a'\n",

    "\n",
    "**Sample Output**:\n",
    "```plaintext\n",
    "Next Alphabetical Element: 'c'\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "*Explanation*:  \n",
    "Since `'a'` is less than `'c'` (the first letter), `'c'` is the smallest letter greater than `'a'`.\n",

    "```plaintext\n",
    "Next Alphabetical Element: 'c'\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "*Explanation*:  \n",
    "Since there is no letter greater than `'j'` in the array, the circular property applies and the first element `'c'` is returned.\n",

    "### Why Use Modified Binary Search?\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Sorted Array Advantage**:\n",
    "   - The letters are sorted in increasing order, which makes binary search an ideal candidate for a fast lookup.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Efficiency**:\n",
    "   - A simple linear scan would be O(n), but binary search reduces the time complexity to O(log n).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Key Cues**:\n",
    "   - The array is sorted and the problem asks for the next element greater than the target.\n",
    "   - The circular nature (wrap-around) of the array is an additional hint: if no letter is found in the binary search, return the first element.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Break Down → Modified Binary Search Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step-by-Step Sub-Tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initial Check for Wrap-Around**:\n",
    "   - If the target is greater than or equal to the last element in the array, return the first element immediately.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Binary Search Initialization**:\n",
    "   - Set `low = 0` and `high = n - 1` (where `n` is the length of the array).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Iterative Process**:\n",
    "   - **Calculate Midpoint**:  \n",
    "     Compute `mid = low + (high - low) / 2`.\n",
    "   - **Decision Making**:\n",
    "     - If `letters[mid]` is less than or equal to the target, then the answer must lie to the right. Update `low = mid + 1`.\n",
    "     - Otherwise, update `high = mid - 1` as `letters[mid]` is a candidate.\n",
    "     \n",
    "4. **Return Result**:\n",
    "   - After the loop, `low` will point to the smallest letter greater than the target.  \n",
    "   - If `low` is within the array bounds, return `letters[low]`; otherwise, return `letters[0]` (circular case).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Explanations + Code\n",
    "\n",
    "### Detailed Explanation\n",
    "- **Initialization**:  \n",
    "  The binary search starts with the entire array range. The edge case is handled first: if the target is greater than or equal to the last element, we return the first element due to the circular array property.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Mid Calculation & Comparison**:  \n",
    "  At each iteration, calculate the midpoint. If the letter at the midpoint is less than or equal to the target, the next candidate must be in the right half; otherwise, it could be the answer (or there might be a better candidate in the left half).\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Pointer Adjustments**:  \n",
    "  Adjust `low` and `high` until `low` exceeds `high`. At that point, `low` indicates the position of the smallest letter greater than the target.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Time Complexity**:  \n",
    "  The search space is halved each iteration, leading to a time complexity of **O(log n)**.\n",

    "**Explanation**:\n",
    "- The function `nextAlphabeticalElement` applies binary search to find the correct candidate.\n",
    "- It first checks the wrap-around condition.\n",
    "- During the search, if `letters[mid]` is less than or equal to the target, it moves the lower bound up; otherwise, it moves the upper bound down.\n",
    "- Finally, it returns the element at index `low`, which is guaranteed to be the smallest letter greater than the target.\n",
