    "# Ceil of an Element in a Sorted Array Handout\n",
    "\n",
    "This handout explains how to determine the **ceil** of a given target value in a sorted array. The **ceil** of a number *x* in an array is defined as the smallest element in the array that is greater than or equal to *x*. We achieve this efficiently using a modified binary search algorithm.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Problem Statement\n",
    "Given a **sorted array** and a target value *x*, find the ceil of *x* in the array. The ceil is the smallest element that is greater than or equal to *x*. If no such element exists (i.e., if *x* is larger than the largest element in the array), the function should indicate that a ceil does not exist (for example, by returning `-1`).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Operations**:\n",
    "- **Search** the array using binary search.\n",
    "- **Maintain** a candidate ceil by updating it when an element ≥ *x* is found.\n",
    "- **Return** the candidate ceil or indicate that none exists.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Inputs\n",
    "- **Array**: A sorted list of integers.\n",
    "- **Target (x)**: The value for which we need to find the ceil.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Outputs\n",
    "- The **ceil value** (the smallest element in the array that is ≥ *x*), or an indicator (such as `-1`) if no such element exists.\n",

    "### Detailed Example\n",

    "**Sample Input**:\n",
    "```plaintext\n",
    "Array: [1, 2, 8, 10, 10, 12, 19]\n",

    "### Why Use Modified Binary Search?\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Sorted Array Advantage**:\n",
    "   - Since the array is sorted, binary search can be applied to quickly narrow down the candidate ceil.\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. **Efficiency**:\n",
    "   - A linear scan would take O(n) time, but binary search finds the ceil in O(log n) time by halving the search space at each iteration.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Key Cues**:\n",
    "   - The sorted property of the array and the need to locate an element based on a comparison (≥ *x*) suggest an adapted binary search strategy.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Break Down → Modified Binary Search Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step-by-Step Sub-Tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initialization**:\n",
    "   - Set two pointers: `low = 0` and `high = n - 1` (where `n` is the length of the array).\n",
    "   - Initialize a variable `ceilIndex = -1` to keep track of the best candidate (starting with none).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Iterative Process**:\n",
    "   - **Compute Midpoint**:  \n",
    "     Calculate `mid = low + (high - low) / 2`.\n",
    "   - **Compare with Target**:\n",
    "     - If `array[mid]` is exactly equal to *x*, then *x* itself is the ceil. Return `array[mid]`.\n",
    "     - If `array[mid]` is greater than *x*, update `ceilIndex` to `mid` (as this is a candidate) and move the `high` pointer to `mid - 1` to search for a possibly smaller candidate that still meets the criteria.\n",
    "     - If `array[mid]` is less than *x*, move the `low` pointer to `mid + 1` to search the right half.\n",
    "     \n",
    "3. **Termination**:\n",
    "   - When `low` exceeds `high`, the search is complete.\n",
    "   - If a candidate was found (`ceilIndex` ≠ -1), return the element at that index as the ceil.\n",
    "   - Otherwise, indicate that no ceil exists.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Data Structures Used**:\n",
    "   - The algorithm operates on an **array**.\n",
    "   - It uses simple integer pointers (`low`, `mid`, `high`) and an index variable (`ceilIndex`) to maintain the candidate.\n",

    "### Detailed Explanation\n",
    "- **Initialization**:  \n",
    "  Start with the entire range of the array and no candidate ceil.\n",
    "- **Mid Calculation & Comparison**:  \n",
    "  The mid element is compared with *x*. If it is greater than or equal to *x*, it becomes the current best candidate and the algorithm searches for a potentially smaller candidate in the left half. Otherwise, the search continues in the right half.\n",
    "- **Pointer Adjustments**:\n",
    "  - When `array[mid]` ≥ *x*, update `ceilIndex` and move left.\n",
    "  - When `array[mid]` < *x*, move right.\n",
    "- **Time Complexity**:  \n",
    "  Since the search space is halved each time, the algorithm runs in **O(log n)**.\n",
