# Introduction to NLP | NLP Lecture 1 | End to End NLP Course

## What is Natural Language Processing (NLP)?

Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a branch of artificial intelligence (AI) that focuses on the interaction between computers and humans through natural language. It enables machines to understand, interpret, and generate human language in a valuable way.

### Key Components of NLP

1. **Natural Language Understanding (NLU)**
   - The ability to comprehend and extract meaning from human language
   - Involves parsing, semantic analysis, and context understanding

2. **Natural Language Generation (NLG)**
   - The ability to produce human-readable text from structured data
   - Includes text summarization, content creation, and response generation

## Why is NLP Important?

### Real-World Applications

- **Search Engines**: Google, Bing use NLP to understand user queries
- **Virtual Assistants**: Siri, Alexa, Google Assistant
- **Machine Translation**: Google Translate, DeepL
- **Social Media**: Sentiment analysis, content moderation
- **Healthcare**: Medical record analysis, drug discovery
- **Finance**: Fraud detection, automated trading, customer support

### Business Impact

- **Customer Service**: Automated chatbots and support systems
- **Content Analysis**: Document processing, information extraction
- **Marketing**: Sentiment analysis, targeted advertising
- **Legal Tech**: Contract analysis, legal document review

## NLP Pipeline Overview

```
Raw Text → Preprocessing → Feature Extraction → Model Training → Prediction/Output
```

### 1. Text Preprocessing
- **Tokenization**: Breaking text into words, sentences, or subwords
- **Cleaning**: Removing noise, special characters, HTML tags
- **Normalization**: Converting to lowercase, handling contractions
- **Stop Words Removal**: Filtering common words (the, is, at, etc.)
- **Stemming/Lemmatization**: Reducing words to root forms

### 2. Feature Extraction
- **Bag of Words (BoW)**: Representing text as word frequency vectors
- **TF-IDF**: Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency
- **N-grams**: Capturing word sequences (bigrams, trigrams)
- **Word Embeddings**: Dense vector representations (Word2Vec, GloVe)

### 3. Model Training
- **Traditional ML**: Naive Bayes, SVM, Random Forest
- **Deep Learning**: RNNs, LSTMs, Transformers
- **Pre-trained Models**: BERT, GPT, T5

## Core NLP Tasks

### 1. Text Classification
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Positive, negative, neutral sentiment
- **Spam Detection**: Identifying unwanted messages
- **Topic Classification**: Categorizing documents by subject
- **Intent Recognition**: Understanding user intentions in chatbots

### 2. Named Entity Recognition (NER)
- Identifying entities like:
  - **Person**: John Smith, Einstein
  - **Location**: New York, Paris
  - **Organization**: Google, Microsoft
  - **Date/Time**: January 1st, 2024

### 3. Text Generation
- **Language Modeling**: Predicting next words in sequence
- **Text Summarization**: Creating concise summaries
- **Machine Translation**: Converting between languages
- **Question Answering**: Generating answers to questions

### 4. Information Extraction
- **Relationship Extraction**: Finding relationships between entities
- **Event Extraction**: Identifying events and participants
- **Keyword Extraction**: Finding important terms

## NLP Challenges

### 1. Language Ambiguity
- **Lexical Ambiguity**: Words with multiple meanings
  - Example: "Bank" (financial institution vs. river bank)
- **Syntactic Ambiguity**: Multiple ways to parse sentences
  - Example: "I saw the man with the telescope"
- **Semantic Ambiguity**: Multiple interpretations
  - Example: "The chicken is ready to eat"

### 2. Context Understanding
- **Coreference Resolution**: Understanding pronoun references
- **Discourse Analysis**: Understanding text flow and coherence
- **Pragmatics**: Understanding implied meaning and context

### 3. Language Variations
- **Dialects and Accents**: Regional language differences
- **Informal Language**: Slang, abbreviations, emojis
- **Code-Switching**: Mixing multiple languages
- **Domain-Specific Language**: Technical jargon, medical terminology

### 4. Data Quality Issues
- **Noise**: Typos, grammatical errors, OCR errors
- **Bias**: Training data reflecting societal biases
- **Sparsity**: Limited data for rare words or languages
- **Annotation Quality**: Inconsistent human labeling

## Traditional vs Modern NLP Approaches

### Traditional Approaches (Rule-Based & Statistical)
- **Rule-Based Systems**:
  - Hand-crafted linguistic rules
  - Expert knowledge required
  - High precision but low coverage
  
- **Statistical Methods**:
  - Feature engineering required
  - Machine learning algorithms (SVM, Naive Bayes)
  - Limited context understanding

### Modern Deep Learning Approaches
- **Neural Networks**:
  - Automatic feature learning
  - Better context understanding
  - End-to-end training

- **Transformer Architecture**:
  - Attention mechanisms
  - Parallel processing
  - State-of-the-art performance

- **Pre-trained Models**:
  - Transfer learning
  - Fine-tuning for specific tasks
  - Reduced training time and data requirements

    # Tokenize
    tokens = text.split()
    # Remove stop words
    tokens = [token for token in tokens if token not in stop_words]
    return ' '.join(tokens)

# 2. Feature extraction
