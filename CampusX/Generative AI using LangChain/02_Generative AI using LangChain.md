## Generative AI using LangChain

- **Recap: Generative AI Curriculum Framework**

  - The field of **Generative AI** can be divided into two main parts:
    - **Builder Side**: Developing **Foundation Models**.
    - **User Side**: Using these **Foundation Models** to create applications.

- **LangChain's Role in the User-Side Curriculum**

  - The **User Side** curriculum encompasses:
    - Building **LLM-based applications**.
    - Techniques to improve LLM responses: **Prompt Engineering, RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation), and Fine-tuning**.
    - The emerging field of **Agentic AI**.
    - **LLM Ops** and other miscellaneous topics.
  - **LangChain** is a starting point for building LLM applications.

- **What is LangChain?**

  - **LangChain** is an **open-source framework**.
  - It helps developers build applications powered by **Large Language Models (LLMs)**.
  - Examples: **chatbots, agents, Question-Answering systems, RAG-based applications, autonomous agents**.
  - **LangChain** provides **modular components** and **end-to-end tools** to simplify development.

- **Core Features & Popularity of LangChain**

  - **Broad LLM Support**: Integrates with almost all major **LLMs** (open-source and closed-source).
  - **Simplified Development**: Abstractions like **Chains** make it easier to build complex **LLM-based applications** and workflows.
  - **Rich Integrations**: Wrappers for easy connection with external tools and services, including databases and deployment platforms.
  - **Free and Open-Source**: Actively developed, with rapid evolution and new components.
  - **Comprehensive Use-Case Coverage**: Helps in building almost all types of applications in the **Generative AI** space.
