- The material introduces a project to build a **Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)** system, referred to as "YouTube Chat."
  - **Significance**: This system aims to solve the problem of efficiently extracting information and interacting with long YouTube videos, such as podcasts or lectures, without needing to watch them in their entirety. Users can ask questions about the video content and receive real-time answers.
- The core idea is to allow users to "chat" with any YouTube video by asking questions and getting summaries or specific details.
  - **Examples**: Asking if a podcast discusses a specific topic (e.g., AI), requesting a summary in bullet points, or clarifying doubts from a lecture.
- The development will be done in a Google Colab notebook using **LangChain**, focusing on functionality over UI, though potential UI options like Chrome plugins or Streamlit websites are mentioned.
  - **LangChain Significance**: A framework designed to simplify the creation of applications using large language models (LLMs). It provides tools and abstractions for various components of a RAG system.

```python
import os

# Install libraries
!pip install -q youtube-transcript-api langchain-community langchain-openai faiss-cpu tiktoken python-dotenv

from youtube_transcript_api import YouTubeTranscriptApi, TranscriptsDisabled
from langchain.text_splitter import RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter
from langchain_openai import OpenAIEmbeddings, ChatOpenAI
from langchain_community.vectorstores import FAISS
from langchain_core.prompts import PromptTemplate
```

**The RAG System Architecture and Workflow:**
The material outlines a practical implementation of a RAG system, following a previously discussed theoretical architecture.

1.  **Data Ingestion and Indexing:** This is the preparatory phase.
    - **Load Transcript**: The first step is to fetch the **transcript** of the target YouTube video. The content mentions using YouTube's own APIs for this, as LangChain's YouTube loader was found to be buggy. The transcript is initially a list of dictionaries with text, start time, and duration, which is then concatenated into a single string.
      - **Transcript Significance**: This is the primary data source (knowledge base) the RAG system will use to answer questions.

```python
# Step 1a - Indexing (Document Ingestion)
video_id = "Gfr50f6ZBvo" # only the ID, not full URL
try:
    # If you don't care which language, this returns the "best" one
    transcript_list = YouTubeTranscriptApi.get_transcript(video_id, languages=["en"])
    # Flatten it to plain text
    transcript = " ".join(chunk["text"] for chunk in transcript_list)
    print(transcript)
except TranscriptsDisabled:
    print("No captions available for this video.")
```

    * **Text Splitting**: The loaded transcript, which can be very long, is divided into smaller, manageable chunks using a **Text Splitter**. The **Recursive Character Text Splitter** is used with a specified chunk size and overlap.
        * **Text Splitters Significance**: Breaking down large texts into smaller chunks is crucial for effective embedding and retrieval, ensuring that the context provided to the LLM is relevant and concise.

```python
# Step 1b - Indexing (Text Splitting)
splitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=1000, chunk_overlap=200)
chunks = splitter.create_documents([transcript])
```

    * **Embeddings Generation**: Each text chunk is converted into a numerical representation (vector embedding) using an **embedding model** (e.g., from **OpenAI**).
        * **Embeddings Significance**: These vector representations capture the semantic meaning of the text chunks, enabling similarity searches.
    * **Vector Storage**: These embeddings are stored in a **Vector Store** (e.g., **FAISS** - Facebook AI Similarity Search). This creates an index for efficient searching.
        * **Vector Stores Significance**: They are databases optimized for storing and searching high-dimensional vectors, forming the core of the retrieval mechanism.
    * **Indexing**: This overall process of loading, splitting, embedding, and storing constitutes the **indexing** phase, preparing the knowledge base for querying.

```python
# Step 1c & 1d - Indexing (Embedding Generation and Storing in Vector Store)
embeddings = OpenAIEmbeddings(model="text-embedding-3-small")
vector_store = FAISS.from_documents(chunks, embeddings)
```

2.  **Retrieval and Generation:** This is the query-time phase.
    - **User Query**: The user asks a question.
    - **Retrieval**:
      - A **Retriever** is created from the vector store. When a query comes in, the retriever embeds the query and performs a **semantic search** in the vector store to find the most relevant text chunks (documents) based on vector similarity.
      - **Retriever Significance**: This component is responsible for fetching the most relevant pieces of information from the indexed knowledge base that can help answer the user's query.

```python
# Step 2 - Retrieval
retriever = vector_store.as_retriever(search_type="similarity", search_kwargs={"k": 4})
```

    * **Augmentation**: The retrieved relevant chunks (context) are combined with the original user query to form a detailed **prompt**. This prompt is then sent to an **LLM**. A **prompt template** is used to structure this input for the LLM, instructing it to answer based on the provided context.
        * **Augmentation Significance**: This step enriches the user's query with relevant information from the source material, guiding the LLM to generate a grounded and accurate answer.

```python
# Step 3 - Augmentation
llm = ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4-mini", temperature=0.2)

prompt = PromptTemplate(
    template="""
You are a helpful assistant.
Answer ONLY from the provided transcript context.
If the context is insufficient, just say you don't know.
{context}

Question: {question}
""",
    input_variables = ['context', 'question']
)

question = "is the topic of nuclear fusion discussed in this video? if yes then what was discussed"
retrieved_docs = retriever.invoke(question)
context_text = "\n\n".join(doc.page_content for doc in retrieved_docs)
final_prompt = prompt.invoke({"context": context_text, "question": question})
```

    * **Generation**: The **LLM** processes the augmented prompt and generates a response to the user's query.
        * **LLM (Large Language Model) Significance**: This is the "brains" of the operation, capable of understanding the query and context, and generating a human-like answer.

```python
# Step 4 - Generation
answer = llm.invoke(final_prompt)
print(answer.content)
```

**Implementation with LangChain:**

- The material details using **LangChain chains** to orchestrate these steps.
  - Initially, the steps (retrieval, prompt formatting, LLM call) are performed manually.
  - Later, these are combined into a **LangChain chain** for a streamlined, automated workflow where the output of one component becomes the input for the next.
  - **RunnableParallel** is used to handle components that need to run in parallel (like fetching context via the retriever and passing through the original question simultaneously).
  - **RunnableLambda** is used to incorporate custom functions (like formatting retrieved documents into a single string) into the chain.
  - **RunnablePassthrough** is used to pass the original question alongside the retrieved context to the prompt.
  - An **output parser** (e.g., `StringOutputParser`) is used to format the LLM's response.

```python
# Building a Chain
from langchain_core.runnables import RunnableParallel, RunnablePassthrough, RunnableLambda
from langchain_core.output_parsers import StrOutputParser

def format_docs(retrieved_docs):
    context_text = "\n\n".join(doc.page_content for doc in retrieved_docs)
    return context_text

parallel_chain = RunnableParallel({
    'context': retriever | RunnableLambda(format_docs),
    'question': RunnablePassthrough()
})

parser = StrOutputParser()
main_chain = parallel_chain | prompt | llm | parser
```
