## Paper References and Context

**Original Research Papers:**
- "Attention Is All You Need" (Vaswani et al., 2017) - [arXiv:1706.03762](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762)

**Video Context:** This video builds upon the foundation of self-attention mechanism to introduce multi-head attention, a crucial component that enables Transformers to capture multiple perspectives and relationships within text simultaneously.

**Learning Journey:** By the end of this comprehensive walkthrough, you will understand why single self-attention heads are limited, how multi-head attention overcomes these limitations, and how the mechanism works both conceptually and mathematically in the original Transformer architecture.

**Connection to Broader Concepts:** Multi-head attention forms the backbone of modern transformer architectures including BERT, GPT, and other state-of-the-art language models, making it essential for understanding contemporary NLP systems.

## Self-Attention Recap: From Static to Contextual Embeddings

Before diving into multi-head attention, let's establish the foundation with self-attention. **Self-attention is a technique for generating contextual embeddings** that can capture the meaning of words based on their surrounding context.

### The Evolution from Static to Contextual Representations

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Sentence: money bank] --> B[Static Embeddings]
    B --> C[Word2Vec/GloVe Fixed representations]
    C --> D[Problem: Same embedding regardless of context]
    
    A --> E[Self-Attention Block]
    E --> F[Contextual Embeddings]
    F --> G[Context-aware representations that adapt based on surrounding words]
    
    style D fill:#ffcccc
    style G fill:#ccffcc
```

**The Core Problem with Static Embeddings:**
Consider the word "bank" in these contexts:
- "money bank" (financial institution)
- "river bank" (riverbank)

Traditional embeddings assign the same numerical representation to "bank" regardless of context, missing crucial semantic differences.

### Self-Attention Architecture Deep Dive

Self-attention solves this by generating three types of vectors for each word:

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph "Input Processing"
        A[money] --> D[E_money 4-dim embedding]
        B[bank] --> E[E_bank 4-dim embedding]
    end
    
    subgraph "Weight Matrices"
        F[W_Q 4×4] 
        G[W_K 4×4]
        H[W_V 4×4]
    end
    
    subgraph "Generated Vectors"
        D --> I[Q_money Query vector]
        D --> J[K_money Key vector]
        D --> K[V_money Value vector]
        
        E --> L[Q_bank Query vector]
        E --> M[K_bank Key vector]
        E --> N[V_bank Value vector]
    end
    
    D -.-> F
    D -.-> G
    D -.-> H
    E -.-> F
    E -.-> G
    E -.-> H
```

**Step-by-Step Self-Attention Process:**

1. **Linear Projections:** Each word embedding is multiplied with three learned weight matrices (W_Q, W_K, W_V)
2. **Attention Score Calculation:** 
   ```
   Score = Q_money · K_bank (dot product)
   Scaled_Score = Score / √(d_k)
   ```
3. **Normalization:** Apply softmax to get attention weights
4. **Weighted Combination:** Multiply attention weights with value vectors

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Q_money] --> D[Dot Product]
    B[K_money] --> D
    C[K_bank] --> D
    D --> E["Scores: [0.8, 0.2]"]
    E --> F[Softmax Normalization]
    F --> G["Weights: [0.69, 0.31]"]
    G --> H[Weighted Sum with V vectors]
    H --> I[Contextual Output]
```

## The Core Problem with Single Self-Attention: Limited Perspective Capture

### Ambiguous Sentence Analysis

Consider this deliberately ambiguous sentence:
**"The man saw the astronomer with a telescope"**

This sentence has two distinct interpretations:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[The man saw the astronomer with a telescope] --> B[Interpretation 1]
    A --> C[Interpretation 2]
    
    B --> D[The man used a telescope <br/>to see the astronomer]
    C --> E[The man saw an astronomer <br/>who had a telescope]
    
    subgraph "Attention Patterns for Interpretation 1"
        F[man] -.-> G[telescope]
        F -.-> H[saw]
        style G fill:#ff9999
    end
    
    subgraph "Attention Patterns for Interpretation 2"  
        I[astronomer] -.-> J[telescope]
        K[man] -.-> L[astronomer]
        style J fill:#99ff99
    end
```

**The Single Self-Attention Limitation:**

Self-attention generates only **one similarity table** for the entire sentence. It can capture either:
- Strong similarity between "man" and "telescope" (Interpretation 1), OR
- Strong similarity between "astronomer" and "telescope" (Interpretation 2)

But it **cannot capture both perspectives simultaneously**.

### Real-World Impact: Document Summarization Example

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Large Document] --> B[Single Self-Attention]
    B --> C[Single Perspective Summary]
    
    A --> D[Multi-Head Attention]
    D --> E[Perspective 1: Technical Focus]
    D --> F[Perspective 2: Business Impact]
    D --> G[Perspective 3: User Benefits]
    E --> H[Comprehensive Multi-Perspective Summary]
    F --> H
    G --> H
    
    style C fill:#ffcccc
    style H fill:#ccffcc
```

**Why This Matters:**
- **Document Summarization:** Different readers need different perspectives
- **Question Answering:** Complex queries may require multiple reasoning paths  
- **Machine Translation:** Ambiguous phrases need multiple interpretation strategies
- **Sentiment Analysis:** Mixed sentiments require nuanced understanding

## Multi-Head Attention: The Elegant Solution

Multi-head attention provides a deceptively simple solution: **"What if we use multiple self-attention modules in parallel?"**

Since we're using more than one self-attention head, we call it **multi-head attention**, where each individual self-attention block is called a "head."

### Conceptual Architecture Comparison

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph "Single Self-Attention (Limited)"
        A1[money bank] --> B1[Self-Attention Block]
        B1 --> C1["Single Weight Set: W_Q,<br/> W_K, W_V"]
        C1 --> D1[One Perspective Output]
    end
    
    subgraph "Multi-Head Attention (Enhanced)"
        A2[money bank] --> B2[Multi-Head Attention]
        B2 --> C2["Head 1: W_Q1, <br/>W_K1, W_V1"]
        B2 --> C3["Head 2: W_Q2,<br/> W_K2, W_V2"]
        C2 --> D2[Perspective 1 Output]
        C3 --> D3[Perspective 2 Output]
        D2 --> E2[Concatenate and Linear Transform]
        D3 --> E2
        E2 --> F2[Combined Multi-Perspective Output]
    end
    
    style D1 fill:#ffcccc
    style F2 fill:#ccffcc
```

### Detailed Multi-Head Processing Flow

**Step 1: Multiple Weight Matrix Sets**

```mermaid
graph LR
    subgraph "Input Embeddings"
        A[E_money 4-dim]
        B[E_bank 4-dim]
    end
    
    subgraph "Head 1 Weights"
        C[W_Q1 4×4]
        D[W_K1 4×4]  
        E[W_V1 4×4]
    end
    
    subgraph "Head 2 Weights"
        F[W_Q2 4×4]
        G[W_K2 4×4]
        H[W_V2 4×4]
    end
    
    A --> C
    A --> D  
    A --> E
    A --> F
    A --> G
    A --> H
    B --> C
    B --> D
    B --> E
    B --> F
    B --> G
    B --> H
```

**Step 2: Parallel Vector Generation**

Each word now generates **multiple sets** of query, key, and value vectors:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[money embedding] --> B[Head 1 Processing]
    A --> C[Head 2 Processing]
    
    B --> D[Q_money1, K_money1, V_money1]
    C --> E[Q_money2, K_money2, V_money2]
    
    F[bank embedding] --> G[Head 1 Processing]
    F --> H[Head 2 Processing]
    
    G --> I[Q_bank1, K_bank1, V_bank1]
    H --> J[Q_bank2, K_bank2, V_bank2]
```

**Step 3: Parallel Self-Attention Computation**

Each head performs complete self-attention independently:

| Head 1 Computation | Head 2 Computation |
|-------------------|-------------------|
| Q_money1 · K_money1 = score₁₁ | Q_money2 · K_money2 = score₂₁ |
| Q_money1 · K_bank1 = score₁₂ | Q_money2 · K_bank2 = score₂₂ |
| Softmax([score₁₁, score₁₂]) = weights₁ | Softmax([score₂₁, score₂₂]) = weights₂ |
| weights₁ · [V_money1, V_bank1] = output₁ | weights₂ · [V_money2, V_bank2] = output₂ |

## Complete Matrix-Form Multi-Head Attention Breakdown

Let's walk through the complete mathematical implementation using our "money bank" example with 2 attention heads:

### Initial Setup: Input Processing

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Sentence: money bank] --> B[Word Embeddings]
    B --> C["E = [E_money; E_bank] Shape: 2×4"]
    
    C --> D[Multi-Head Attention 2 Heads]
```

**Input Matrix:**
```
E = [money_embedding]  = [e₁, e₂, e₃, e₄]  (2×4 matrix)
    [bank_embedding ]    [e₅, e₆, e₇, e₈]
```
### Head 1 and Head 2: Weight Matrices
![Head Weight Matrices](images/77/image.png)
```mermaid
graph LR
    subgraph "Head 1 Weight Matrices (4×4 each)"
        A["W_Q1 purple matrix"]
        B["W_K1 green matrix"]  
        C["W_V1 blue matrix"]
    end
    
    subgraph "Head 2 Weight Matrices (4×4 each)"
        D["W_Q2 purple matrix"]
        E["W_K2 green matrix"]
        F["W_V2 blue matrix"]
    end
```

### Step-by-Step Matrix Operations

**Step 1: Generate Query, Key, Value Matrices for Both Heads**

```python
# Head 1 computations
Q1 = E @ W_Q1  # (2×4) @ (4×4) = (2×4)
K1 = E @ W_K1  # (2×4) @ (4×4) = (2×4) 
V1 = E @ W_V1  # (2×4) @ (4×4) = (2×4)

# Head 2 computations  
Q2 = E @ W_Q2  # (2×4) @ (4×4) = (2×4)
K2 = E @ W_K2  # (2×4) @ (4×4) = (2×4)
V2 = E @ W_V2  # (2×4) @ (4×4) = (2×4)
```

**Resulting Matrices:**
```
Q1 = [Q_money1]  Q2 = [Q_money2]
     [Q_bank1 ]       [Q_bank2 ]

K1 = [K_money1]  K2 = [K_money2] 
     [K_bank1 ]       [K_bank2 ]

V1 = [V_money1]  V2 = [V_money2]
     [V_bank1 ]       [V_bank2 ]
```

**Step 2: Self-Attention Computation for Each Head**

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Q1 as Q1 Matrix
    participant K1 as K1 Matrix  
    participant V1 as V1 Matrix
    participant Z1 as Output Z1
    
    Q1->>K1: Attention_Scores1 = Q1 @ K1^T
    K1->>Q1: Apply scaling and softmax
    Q1->>V1: Attention_Weights1 @ V1
    V1->>Z1: Contextual Output Z1
```

```python
# Head 1 Self-Attention
Attention_Scores1 = Q1 @ K1.T / sqrt(d_k)  # (2×4) @ (4×2) = (2×2)
Attention_Weights1 = softmax(Attention_Scores1)  # (2×2)
Z1 = Attention_Weights1 @ V1  # (2×2) @ (2×4) = (2×4)

# Head 2 Self-Attention (parallel computation)
Attention_Scores2 = Q2 @ K2.T / sqrt(d_k)  # (2×2)
Attention_Weights2 = softmax(Attention_Scores2)  # (2×2) 
Z2 = Attention_Weights2 @ V2  # (2×4)
```
![concat](images/77/image-1.png)

**Step 3: Concatenation and Linear Transformation**
```mermaid
graph TD
    A["Z1: Head 1 Output 2×4"] --> C[Concatenate]
    B["Z2: Head 2 Output 2×4"] --> C
    C --> D["Z_combined 2×8"]
    D --> E["Linear Transform W_O: 8×4"]
    E --> F["Final Output 2×4"]
    
    style F fill:#ccffcc
```

```python
# Concatenation along feature dimension
Z_combined = concatenate([Z1, Z2], axis=1)  # (2×8)

# Linear transformation to restore original dimensions
W_O = learned_weight_matrix  # (8×4) 
final_output = Z_combined @ W_O  # (2×8) @ (8×4) = (2×4)
```

**Mathematical Summary:**
```latex
\text{MultiHead}(Q,K,V) = \text{Concat}(\text{head}_1, \text{head}_2)W^O
```
where:
```latex
\text{head}_i = \text{Attention}(QW_i^Q, KW_i^K, VW_i^V)
```

## Original Transformer Paper Implementation: 8-Head Architecture with Dimension Reduction

The original "Attention Is All You Need" paper implements a more sophisticated version with **8 attention heads** and **strategic dimension reduction** for computational efficiency.

### Key Architectural Changes from Our Simple Example

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph "Original Transformer Specifications"
        A["Embedding Dimension: 512"]
        B["Number of Heads: 8"]  
        C["Head Dimension: 64"]
        D["Total Parameters: Same as single 512-dim attention"]
    end
    
    A --> E["Strategic Design Choice: 512 ÷ 8 = 64 dimensions per head"]
    B --> E
    C --> E
    E --> F["Computational Efficiency + Multiple Perspectives"]
```

### Detailed Implementation Architecture

**Step 1: Enhanced Input Processing**

```mermaid
graph LR
    A["Input: money bank"] --> B["512-dim Embeddings"]
    B --> C["E matrix 2×512"]
    
    C --> D["Head 1: W_Q1, W_K1, W_V1"]
    C --> E["Head 2: W_Q2, W_K2, W_V2"] 
    C --> F["..."]
    C --> G["Head 8: W_Q8, W_K8, W_V8"]
    
    style C fill:#ffffcc
```

**Step 2: Dimension Reduction Through Weight Matrices**

Instead of maintaining 512 dimensions throughout, each head reduces to 64 dimensions:

```python
# Each weight matrix is 512×64 (not 512×512)
W_Q1, W_K1, W_V1 = (512, 64)  # Head 1 weights
W_Q2, W_K2, W_V2 = (512, 64)  # Head 2 weights
# ... continuing for all 8 heads
W_Q8, W_K8, W_V8 = (512, 64)  # Head 8 weights

# Resulting Q,K,V matrices for each head
Q1 = E @ W_Q1  # (2×512) @ (512×64) = (2×64)
K1 = E @ W_K1  # (2×512) @ (512×64) = (2×64)  
V1 = E @ W_V1  # (2×512) @ (512×64) = (2×64)
```

**Step 3: Parallel Self-Attention on Reduced Dimensions**

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph "8 Parallel Self-Attention Computations"
        A["Head 1: 64-dim vectors"] --> A1["Z1: 2×64"]
        B["Head 2: 64-dim vectors"] --> B1["Z2: 2×64"]
        C["Head 3: 64-dim vectors"] --> C1["Z3: 2×64"]
        D["..."]
        E["Head 8: 64-dim vectors"] --> E1["Z8: 2×64"]
    end
    
    A1 --> F[Concatenation]
    B1 --> F
    C1 --> F
    E1 --> F
    F --> G["Combined Output: 2×512"]
```

**Step 4: Final Linear Transformation**

```python
# Concatenation restores full dimensionality
Z_concat = concatenate([Z1, Z2, Z3, ..., Z8], axis=1)  # (2×512)

# Final linear transformation  
W_O = learned_matrix  # (512×512)
final_output = Z_concat @ W_O  # (2×512) @ (512×512) = (2×512)
```

### Complete Mathematical Flow

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant E as "Input E (2×512)"
    participant W as "Weight Matrices (512×64 each)"
    participant H as "8 Heads (64-dim each)"
    participant C as "Concatenation (2×512)"
    participant O as "Output Layer (512×512)"
    participant F as "Final Output (2×512)"
    
    E->>W: Linear projections for 8 heads
    W->>H: Q1,K1,V1 ... Q8,K8,V8 (all 2×64)
    H->>H: 8 parallel self-attention computations
    H->>C: Concatenate all head outputs
    C->>O: Final linear transformation W_O
    O->>F: Restore original dimensions
```

**Dimension Tracking Table:**

| Stage | Matrix Dimensions | Description |
|-------|------------------|-------------|
| Input Embeddings | 2×512 | Original word embeddings |
| Weight Matrices | 512×64 (×24 total) | 8 heads × 3 matrices each |
| Q,K,V per Head | 2×64 each | Reduced dimension vectors |
| Head Outputs | 2×64 each | Self-attention results |
| Concatenated | 2×512 | All heads combined |
| Final Output | 2×512 | After W_O transformation |

## Computational Efficiency: The Genius of Dimension Reduction

The dimension reduction strategy (512 → 64 per head) provides **the best of both worlds**: multiple perspectives without computational overhead.

### Computational Analysis

**Scenario A: Single 512-Dimension Self-Attention**
```python
# Computational complexity for single head
Q = E @ W_Q  # (2×512) @ (512×512) = O(512²) operations per attention computation
K = E @ W_K  # (2×512) @ (512×512) = O(512²) operations  
V = E @ W_V  # (2×512) @ (512×512) = O(512²) operations
# Total: ~3 × 512² operations for projections + attention computation
```

**Scenario B: 8-Head Multi-Head Attention with Dimension Reduction**
```python
# Computational complexity for 8 heads
# Each head: (2×512) @ (512×64) = O(512×64) operations
# 8 heads × 3 matrices = 24 × O(512×64) = O(8 × 3 × 512×64)
# Total: 24 × 32,768 = ~786k operations vs ~786k operations (same!)
```

### Efficiency Comparison Visualization

```mermaid
graph LR
    subgraph "Computational Comparison"
        A["Single 512-dim Head"] --> A1["512² × 3 matrices ≈ 786k operations"]
        B["8 × 64-dim Heads"] --> B1["8 × 64² × 3 matrices ≈ 786k operations"]
    end
    
    A1 --> C["Same Computational Cost"]
    B1 --> C
    
    C --> D["But 8× More Perspectives!"]
    
    style D fill:#ccffcc
```

**The Strategic Advantage:**
- **Computational Cost:** Identical to single-head attention
- **Representational Power:** 8× more perspectives captured
- **Memory Efficiency:** Parallel processing of smaller matrices
- **Training Stability:** Smaller attention matrices are easier to optimize

from attention_to_gif import AttentionVisualizer
from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModel
import torch

# Load model and tokenizer
model_name = 'bert-base-uncased'
model = AutoModel.from_pretrained(model_name, output_attentions=True)
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)

# Create visualizer
visualizer = AttentionVisualizer(model, tokenizer)

# Generate attention animation for our example sentence
sentence = "The man saw the astronomer with a telescope"
attention_data = visualizer.get_attention_data(sentence)

# Create animated GIF showing attention across all layers
visualizer.save_visualization(
    viz_name='Multi_Head_Attention_Animation.gif',
    fps=2,  # Frames per second
    head_to_viz=0,  # Visualize head 0
    figsize=(12, 8)
)

# Create comparison animation of different heads
for head in range(8):  # BERT has 8 attention heads
    visualizer.save_visualization(
        viz_name=f'Head_{head}_Attention.gif',
        fps=3,
        head_to_viz=head,
        figsize=(10, 6)
    )
```

**🎨 Customization Options:**
```python
# Advanced animation settings
visualizer.save_visualization(
    viz_name='Custom_Attention_Animation.gif',
    fps=2.5,
    head_to_viz=0,
    figsize=(14, 10),
    layer_range=(0, 12),  # Show layers 0-12
    colormap='viridis',   # Custom color scheme
    show_token_labels=True,
    animation_duration=5  # Seconds
)
```

## Key Takeaways

- **Multi-head attention solves single-perspective limitation** of self-attention by running multiple attention computations in parallel
- **Each head captures different semantic relationships** within the same input sequence  
- **Dimension reduction strategy** (512→64 per head) maintains computational efficiency while enabling multiple perspectives
- **Linear transformation** at the end balances and combines insights from all attention heads
- **Interactive visualizations** confirm that different heads specialize in different types of relationships

## Implementation Comparison

| Aspect | Single Self-Attention | Multi-Head Attention |
|--------|----------------------|---------------------|
| Perspectives | 1 | 8 (in original paper) |
| Computational Cost | O(d²) | O(d²) (same!) |
| Weight Matrices | 3 | 24 (8×3) |
| Ambiguity Handling | Limited | Enhanced |

## Research Impact

Multi-head attention has become the foundation for:
- **BERT:** Bidirectional understanding through multiple attention perspectives
- **GPT series:** Autoregressive generation with rich contextual modeling  
- **T5, BART:** Sequence-to-sequence tasks requiring complex relationship modeling
- **Vision Transformers:** Extending multi-head attention to computer vision

The elegant simplicity of parallel self-attention heads has revolutionized how we model complex relationships in sequential data, making it one of the most influential architectural innovations in modern deep learning.
