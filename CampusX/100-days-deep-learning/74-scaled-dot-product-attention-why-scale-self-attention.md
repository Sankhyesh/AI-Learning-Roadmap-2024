## Introduction: The Missing Piece in Self-Attention

In our previous videos, we built self-attention from first principles, creating the foundation for understanding contextual embeddings. However, when we compare our implementation to the original "Attention Is All You Need" paper, there's one crucial difference: **scaling**. 

The original paper uses a scaling factor of $\frac{1}{\sqrt{d_k}}$ in their attention formula, transforming basic dot-product attention into **scaled dot-product attention**. This video explores the mathematical reasoning behind this scaling and why it's essential for stable training.

## Quick Recap: Self-Attention Architecture

Before diving into scaling, let's review our self-attention implementation:

```mermaid
graph LR
    subgraph "Input Processing"
        A[Money Bank Grows] --> B[Word Embeddings]
        B --> C[E_money, E_bank, E_grows]
    end
    
    subgraph "Weight Matrices"
        D[W_Q] 
        E[W_K]
        F[W_V]
    end
    
    subgraph "Vector Generation"
        C --> G[Query Vectors: Q_money, Q_bank, Q_grows]
        C --> H[Key Vectors: K_money, K_bank, K_grows]
        C --> I[Value Vectors: V_money, V_bank, V_grows]
    end
    
    subgraph "Matrix Operations"
        G --> J[Q Matrix 3×3]
        H --> K[K Matrix 3×3]
        I --> L[V Matrix 3×3]
    end
    
    subgraph "Attention Calculation"
        J --> M[QK^T]
        K --> M
        M --> N[Softmax]
        N --> O[Attention Weights]
        O --> P[Final Output]
        L --> P
    end
```

Our implementation follows this mathematical formula:
$$\text{Attention} = \text{softmax}(QK^T)V$$

## What is $d_k$? Understanding the Dimension

The term $d_k$ represents the **dimension of the key vectors**. In our example:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Embedding Dimension: 3] --> B[W_K Matrix: 3×3]
    B --> C[Key Vectors: 3D each]
    C --> D[d_k = 3]
    
    E[Higher Dimensions] --> F[Embedding: 512D]
    F --> G[W_K: 512×512]
    G --> H[Key Vectors: 512D]
    H --> I[d_k = 512]
```

**Key Point**: In most implementations, $d_q = d_k = d_v$ (query, key, and value dimensions are equal).

## The Scaling Formula in Action

With our 3-dimensional example, the scaled attention becomes:

$$\text{Attention} = \text{softmax}\left(\frac{QK^T}{\sqrt{3}}\right)V$$

This means every element in the $QK^T$ matrix is divided by $\sqrt{3}$ before applying softmax.

### Step-by-Step Matrix Calculation Example

Let's work through a concrete example with actual numbers, exactly as shown in the video:

**Step 1: Input Setup - "Money Bank Grows"**

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph "Word Embeddings (3D)"
        A["E_money = [2, 1, 3]"]
        B["E_bank = [1, 2, 1]"] 
        C["E_grows = [0, 1, 2]"]
    end
    
    subgraph "Weight Matrices (3×3)"
        D["W_Q = [[1,0,1], [0,1,0], [1,1,1]]"]
        E["W_K = [[1,1,0], [0,1,1], [1,0,1]]"]
        F["W_V = [[1,0,0], [0,1,0], [0,0,1]]"]
    end
    
    A --> G[Query Vectors]
    B --> G
    C --> G
    D --> G
    
    A --> H[Key Vectors]
    B --> H
    C --> H
    E --> H
```

**Step 2: Generate Q, K, V Matrices**

```mermaid
graph LR
    subgraph "Query Matrix Q"
        A["q_money = [2, 1, 3]<br/>q_bank = [1, 2, 1]<br/>q_grows = [0, 1, 2]"]
    end
    
    subgraph "Key Matrix K^T"
        B["k_money^T = [1, 0, 2]<br/>k_bank^T = [2, 1, 0]<br/>k_grows^T = [1, 3, 1]"]
    end
    
    subgraph "Matrix Multiplication QK^T"
        C["Result: 3×3 Matrix<br/>9 dot products"]
    end
    
    A --> C
    B --> C
```

**Step 3: Detailed QK^T Computation**

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph "Row 1: q_money with all keys"
        A1["q_money · k_money = [2,1,3] · [1,0,2] = 2×1 + 1×0 + 3×2 = 8"]
        A2["q_money · k_bank = [2,1,3] · [2,1,0] = 2×2 + 1×1 + 3×0 = 5"]
        A3["q_money · k_grows = [2,1,3] · [1,3,1] = 2×1 + 1×3 + 3×1 = 8"]
    end
    
    subgraph "Row 2: q_bank with all keys" 
        B1["q_bank · k_money = [1,2,1] · [1,0,2] = 1×1 + 2×0 + 1×2 = 3"]
        B2["q_bank · k_bank = [1,2,1] · [2,1,0] = 1×2 + 2×1 + 1×0 = 4"]
        B3["q_bank · k_grows = [1,2,1] · [1,3,1] = 1×1 + 2×3 + 1×1 = 8"]
    end
    
    subgraph "Row 3: q_grows with all keys"
        C1["q_grows · k_money = [0,1,2] · [1,0,2] = 0×1 + 1×0 + 2×2 = 4"]
        C2["q_grows · k_bank = [0,1,2] · [2,1,0] = 0×2 + 1×1 + 2×0 = 1"]
        C3["q_grows · k_grows = [0,1,2] · [1,3,1] = 0×1 + 1×3 + 2×1 = 5"]
    end
    
    subgraph "Final QK^T Matrix"
        D["[[8, 5, 8],<br/> [3, 4, 8],<br/> [4, 1, 5]]"]
    end
    
    A1 --> D
    A2 --> D
    A3 --> D
    B1 --> D
    B2 --> D
    B3 --> D
    C1 --> D
    C2 --> D
    C3 --> D
```

**Step 4: Apply Scaling Factor (√d_k = √3 ≈ 1.73)**

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph "Original QK^T Matrix"
        A["[[8, 5, 8],<br/> [3, 4, 8],<br/> [4, 1, 5]]<br/><br/>Variance ≈ 6.89"]
    end
    
    subgraph "Scaling Operation"
        B["Divide each element<br/>by √3 = 1.73"]
    end
    
    subgraph "Scaled Matrix"
        C["[[4.62, 2.89, 4.62],<br/> [1.73, 2.31, 4.62],<br/> [2.31, 0.58, 2.89]]<br/><br/>Variance ≈ 2.30"]
    end
    
    A --> B
    B --> C
    
    style A fill:#ffcccc
    style C fill:#ccffcc
```

**Step 5: Variance Analysis**

```mermaid
graph LR
    subgraph "Unscaled Problem"
        A[Original Values:<br/>8, 5, 8, 3, 4, 8, 4, 1, 5]
        A --> B[High Variance: 6.89]
        B --> C[Extreme Softmax:<br/>Some ≈ 0.95, others ≈ 0.01]
    end
    
    subgraph "Scaled Solution"
        D[Scaled Values:<br/>4.62, 2.89, 4.62, 1.73, 2.31, 4.62, 2.31, 0.58, 2.89]
        D --> E[Reduced Variance: 2.30]
        E --> F[Balanced Softmax:<br/>More even distribution]
    end
    
    style C fill:#ffcccc
    style F fill:#ccffcc
```

```python
# Implementation example
import numpy as np

# After computing QK^T
attention_scores = np.dot(Q, K.T)  # Shape: (3, 3)

# Apply scaling
scaled_scores = attention_scores / np.sqrt(d_k)  # d_k = 3

# Apply softmax
attention_weights = softmax(scaled_scores)

# Final output
output = np.dot(attention_weights, V)
```

## The Core Problem: Dot Product Nature

The fundamental issue lies in the **nature of dot products** and how they behave with increasing dimensions. As the instructor emphasizes, this is a conceptual understanding that many skip over with just a one-line justification.

### Matrix Multiplication as Vector Dot Products

When we compute $QK^T$, we're actually performing multiple vector dot products. Let's understand this step by step:

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph "Understanding QK^T as Vector Operations"
        A["Q Matrix has 3 vectors"] --> D["9 Individual Dot Products"]
        B["K^T Matrix has 3 vectors"] --> D
        C["3 × 3 = 9 combinations"] --> D
    end
    
    subgraph "Behind the Scenes"
        D --> E["Each matrix element =<br/>one vector dot product"]
        E --> F["9 scalar results<br/>stored in 3×3 matrix"]
        F --> G["Can compute mean and variance<br/>of these 9 numbers"]
    end
```

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph "Q Matrix (3×3)"
        A[q1: Query for 'money']
        B[q2: Query for 'bank'] 
        C[q3: Query for 'grows']
    end
    
    subgraph "K^T Matrix (3×3)"
        D[k1: Key for 'money']
        E[k2: Key for 'bank']
        F[k3: Key for 'grows']
    end
    
    subgraph "Resulting 9 Dot Products"
        G[q1·k1] --> H[Score matrix]
        I[q1·k2] --> H
        J[q1·k3] --> H
        K[q2·k1] --> H
        L[q2·k2] --> H
        M[q2·k3] --> H
        N[q3·k1] --> H
        O[q3·k2] --> H
        P[q3·k3] --> H
    end
```

## Experimental Evidence: Dimension vs Variance

As mentioned in the video, this concept can be proven empirically. The instructor created code to demonstrate this relationship:

### The Nature of Dot Products: A Core Insight

**Key Statement from Video**: "Dot product ka nature yeh hota hai ki jab aapke paas low dimension vectors hote hain toh unke dot products se jo variance milta hai vo bhi low variance hota hai"

Let's examine how vector dimensions affect the variance of dot products:

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph "Dot Product Nature Explanation"
        A[Low Dimension Vectors] --> B[Low Variance in Dot Products]
        C[High Dimension Vectors] --> D[High Variance in Dot Products]
        
        B --> E[Example: 2D vectors give variance σ₁²]
        D --> F[Example: 3D vectors give variance σ₂² > σ₁²]
    end
    
    subgraph "Intuitive Understanding"
        G[More dimensions = More terms in dot product]
        H[More terms = More variability]
        I[More variability = Higher variance]
        
        G --> H
        H --> I
    end
```

### Experiment Setup
```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

def compute_dot_product_variance(dimension, num_pairs=1000):
    """Compute variance of dot products for given dimension"""
    dot_products = []
    
    for _ in range(num_pairs):
        # Generate random vectors
        v1 = np.random.randn(dimension)
        v2 = np.random.randn(dimension)
        
        # Compute dot product
        dot_product = np.dot(v1, v2)
        dot_products.append(dot_product)
    
    return np.var(dot_products)

# Test different dimensions
dimensions = [3, 100, 1000]
variances = []

for dim in dimensions:
    variance = compute_dot_product_variance(dim)
    variances.append(variance)
    print(f"Dimension {dim}: Variance = {variance:.2f}")
```

### Results Visualization - Video's Experimental Evidence

The instructor ran the experiment with 1000 pairs of vectors for each dimension:

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph "3D Vectors Experiment"
        A[1000 pairs of 3D vectors] --> A1[1000 dot products]
        A1 --> A2[Histogram: Range -6 to +6]
        A2 --> A3[Low variance distribution]
    end
    
    subgraph "100D Vectors Experiment"  
        B[1000 pairs of 100D vectors] --> B1[1000 dot products]
        B1 --> B2[Histogram: Range -10 to +10]
        B2 --> B3[Medium variance distribution]
    end
    
    subgraph "1000D Vectors Experiment"
        C[1000 pairs of 1000D vectors] --> C1[1000 dot products]
        C1 --> C2[Histogram: Range -30 to +30]
        C2 --> C3[High variance distribution]
    end
    
    subgraph "Combined Visualization"
        D[Three curves plotted together]
        A3 --> D
        B3 --> D  
        C3 --> D
        D --> E[Clear pattern: Higher dimension = Higher variance]
    end
    
    style A3 fill:#ccffcc
    style B3 fill:#ffffcc
    style C3 fill:#ffcccc
```

**Video's Key Observation**: "Jaise jaise dimension badh raha hai, variance bhi badh raha hai" - As dimension increases, variance increases proportionally.

        F[High Variance] --> I[Training Problems]
    end
    
    A --> D
    B --> E
    C --> F
```

## The Variance Problem in Training

High variance in attention scores creates significant training problems:

### Detailed Softmax Comparison with Matrix Example

Using our calculated matrices:

**Before Scaling: Softmax on Original Scores**
```
Original Matrix = [[5,  10,  7],
                   [6,   5,  3],
                   [4,   7,  2]]

Row 1 Softmax: softmax([5, 10, 7])
- exp(5) = 148.4, exp(10) = 22026.5, exp(7) = 1096.6
- Sum = 23271.5
- Probabilities: [0.006, 0.947, 0.047]  # Extreme concentration!
```

**After Scaling: Softmax on Scaled Scores**
```
Scaled Matrix = [[2.89,  5.78,  4.05],
                 [3.47,  2.89,  1.73],
                 [2.31,  4.05,  1.16]]

Row 1 Softmax: softmax([2.89, 5.78, 4.05])
- exp(2.89) = 18.0, exp(5.78) = 323.6, exp(4.05) = 57.4
- Sum = 399.0
- Probabilities: [0.045, 0.811, 0.144]  # More balanced distribution!
```

## Classroom Analogy: The Height Variance Problem

The instructor provides an excellent analogy to explain the training problem. This analogy perfectly captures why high variance is problematic:

**Video Quote**: "Imagine ek classroom hai aur us classroom mein bachche baithe hue hain aur bachon ko doubts aa rahe hain"

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph "The Classroom Setup"
        A[Teacher wants to clear doubts]
        B[Students raise hands <br/> to ask questions]
        C[Teacher can only see and <br/>respond to visible hands]
    end
    
    subgraph "Problem Statement"
        D[Student heights have high <br/>variance]
        E[Some students very tall <br/>- 6 feet]
        F[Some students short <br/>- 3 feet]
        
        D --> E
        D --> F
    end
```

Imagine a classroom where students want to ask questions:

### High Variance Scenario (Unscaled) - The Problem

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph "High Variance Classroom"
        A[Mixed height students<br/>High variance in height]
        B[Tall students: Very visible<br/>when hands raised]

    end
    
    subgraph "Teacher's Response"
        D[Teacher sees only tall students]
        E[Focuses on tall students' doubts]
        F[Short students get ignored]
    end
    
    subgraph "Learning Outcome"
        G[Only learns from tall students' questions]
        H[Misses diverse perspectives from short students]

    style I fill:#ffcccc
```

**Video Insight**: "Over time kya ho raha hai ki jo chhote bachche hain inke doubts solve nahi ho rahe... sirf lambe bachon ke doubts ke through learning ho pa rahi hai"

### Low Variance Scenario (Scaled) - The Solution

```mermaid

### Mapping Analogy to Attention Mechanism

```mermaid

    subgraph "Classroom Analogy"
        A[Student heights = Attention scores]
        B[Teacher's focus = Training process]
        C[Answered questions = Updated parameters]
        D[Ignored students = Vanishing gradients]
    end
    
    subgraph "Attention Mechanism"
        E[High variance scores = Tall students]
        F[Low variance scores = Short students]
        G[Gradient updates = Learning from questions]
        H[Vanishing gradients = Ignored students]
    end
    
    A --> E
    B --> G
    C --> G
    D --> H
```

## Mathematical Derivation: Why √dk?

Let's derive the scaling factor mathematically:

### The Simple Solution: Variance Reduction 

Before deriving the mathematical scaling factor, let's understand the basic principle with a simple example from the video:

**Video's Simple Example**:
```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph "Original Numbers"
        A["Numbers: [10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70]<br/>Variance = 400 (Too High!)"]
    end
    
    subgraph "Scaling Solution"
        B["Divide all by 10"]
    end
    
    subgraph "Scaled Numbers"
        C["Numbers: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]<br/>Variance = 4 (Reduced!)"]
    end
    
    A --> B
    B --> C
    
    style A fill:#ffcccc
    style C fill:#ccffcc
```

**Key Insight**: "Bahut simple hai... scale kar do!" - The solution is to scale down the numbers.

**The Big Question**: "Yahan par hum kis cheez se divide karenge?" - What should we divide by?

### Step 1: Single Row Analysis - Concrete Example

The instructor focuses on analyzing just the first row to understand the pattern:
![alt text](images/74/image2.png)
**Video Quote**: "Thodi der ke liye hum pure matrix par focus na karke sirf pehle row par focus karenge"

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph "Focus Strategy"

**1D Vector Example:**
```
v1 = [a], v4 = [b], v5 = [c], v6 = [d]

Dot products:
s11 = a × b = ab
s12 = a × c = ac  
s13 = a × d = ad

First row = [ab, ac, ad]
Expected variance = Var(X) for random variable X
```

**2D Vector Example:**
```
v1 = [a, b], v4 = [c, d], v5 = [e, f], v6 = [g, h]

Dot products:
s11 = ac + bd
s12 = ae + bf
s13 = ag + bh

First row = [ac+bd, ae+bf, ag+bh]
Expected variance = 2 × Var(X) (roughly double!)
```

**3D Vector Example:**
```
v1 = [a, b, c], v4 = [d, e, f], v5 = [g, h, i], v6 = [j, k, l]

Dot products:
s11 = ad + be + cf
s12 = ag + bh + ci
s13 = aj + bk + cl

First row = [ad+be+cf, ag+bh+ci, aj+bk+cl]
Expected variance = 3 × Var(X) (triple!)
```

### Step 2: Scaling to Higher Dimensions

For 2D vectors: $v_1 = [a,b], v_4 = [c,d], ...$

Dot products: $s_{11} = ac + bd, s_{12} = ae + bf, ...$

Expected variance: $\text{Var}(Y) = 2 \times \text{Var}(X)$

For 3D vectors: Expected variance: $\text{Var}(Z) = 3 \times \text{Var}(X)$

### General Pattern
$$\text{Var}(\text{d-dimensional}) = d \times \text{Var}(X)$$

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[1D: Var = Var-X] --> B[2D: Var = 2 times Var-X]
    B --> C[3D: Var = 3 times Var-X]
    C --> D[dD: Var = d times Var-X]
    
    E[Goal: Keep variance constant] --> F[Divide by sqrt-d]
    F --> G[All dimensions: Var = Var-X]
```

### Step 3: Applying Scaling Property

**Mathematical Property**: If $Y = cX$, then $\text{Var}(Y) = c^2 \cdot \text{Var}(X)$

To achieve constant variance:
- Original variance: $d \times \text{Var}(X)$  
- Scale by $\frac{1}{\sqrt{d}}$
- New variance: $\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{d}}\right)^2 \times d \times \text{Var}(X) = \text{Var}(X)$

**Applying to Our Examples:**
```
1D: Original variance = 16.33
    Scaled by 1/√1 = 1 → Variance remains 16.33

2D: Original variance = 17.33  
    Scaled by 1/√2 = 0.707 → Each value × 0.707
    New variance = (0.707)² × 17.33 = 8.66 ≈ 16.33 ✓

3D: Original variance = 52.33
    Scaled by 1/√3 = 0.577 → Each value × 0.577  
    New variance = (0.577)² × 52.33 = 17.44 ≈ 16.33 ✓
```

    C --> D[Simplified: 1 times Var-X]
    D --> E[Final: Var-X]

## Complete Scaled Dot-Product Attention

The final formula becomes:

$$\text{Attention}(Q,K,V) = \text{softmax}\left(\frac{QK^T}{\sqrt{d_k}}\right)V$$

### Implementation Steps:
1. **Compute attention scores**: $QK^T$
2. **Apply scaling**: Divide by $\sqrt{d_k}$  
3. **Apply softmax**: Convert to probabilities
4. **Weight values**: Multiply by $V$

```python
def scaled_dot_product_attention(Q, K, V, d_k):
    """
    Implements scaled dot-product attention
    
    Args:
        Q: Query matrix (seq_len, d_k)
        K: Key matrix (seq_len, d_k) 
        V: Value matrix (seq_len, d_v)
        d_k: Dimension of key vectors
    
    Returns:
        Attention output (seq_len, d_v)
    """
    # Step 1: Compute attention scores
    scores = np.dot(Q, K.T)
    
    # Step 2: Scale by sqrt(d_k)
    scaled_scores = scores / np.sqrt(d_k)
    
    # Step 3: Apply softmax
    attention_weights = softmax(scaled_scores)
    
    # Step 4: Apply to values
    output = np.dot(attention_weights, V)
    
    return output, attention_weights

def softmax(x):
    """Numerical stable softmax"""
    exp_x = np.exp(x - np.max(x, axis=-1, keepdims=True))
    return exp_x / np.sum(exp_x, axis=-1, keepdims=True)
```
