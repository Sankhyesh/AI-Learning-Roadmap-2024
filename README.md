# Roadmap to Learning AI in 2024

## README

### Overview
This repository provides a comprehensive roadmap for learning Artificial Intelligence (AI) in 2024. It follows a hands-on, project-based approach, covering essential mathematics, programming tools, machine learning fundamentals, deep learning techniques, and natural language processing. This README file includes an overview of the course structure, recommended resources, and placeholders for YouTube video links that will be added to enhance the learning experience.
