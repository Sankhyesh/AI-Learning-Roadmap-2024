*   **`data/`**: Intended for storing datasets or data-related utilities.
*   **`.vscode/`**: Contains workspace settings and configurations for Visual Studio Code.
*   **`static/`**: Shared static assets (CSS, JS) for web-based projects or quizzes within the repository.
*   **Other Files**:
    *   `LICENSE`: The license for this repository.
    *   `README.md`: This file!
    *   `.gitignore`: Specifies intentionally untracked files that Git should ignore.
    *   `Coding.md`: General notes related to coding.
    *   `quiz_template.html`, `sample_quiz.html`: Templates for creating quizzes.
    *   `start_spark_notebook.bat`: A batch script for starting Spark notebooks.
